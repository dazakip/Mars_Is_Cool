the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC), I forgot to post about the sol 1640-42 plan. Better late than never!</p>
<p>The weekend plan started with some Navcam atmospheric
observations, followed by ChemCam on the bedrock target “Big Moose Mountain”.
Mastcam documented the ChemCam target and then did some deck monitoring and
atmospheric dust observations. Then MAHLI and APXS analyzed the excellently-named
targets “Junk of Pork Island” and “Uncle Steve’s Point”.</p>
<p>On Sol 1641, ChemCam analyzed “Dram Island” and “Frye Island”.
Mastcam documented those targets and the APXS targets with a couple of small
mosaics, and also observed the target “Anasagunticook”. We also ran some drill
diagnostics.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 0.92em;">On Sol 1642 our main activity was a drive with typical
post-drive imaging and MARDI.</span></p><p>Now, back to LPSC!

</p><p>MSL drove about 28 meters toward the south on Sol 1642 and
again is in an area with Murray Formation bedrock blocks surrounded by
dark sand.&nbsp; I helped plan ChemCam observations today, and we settled on a
target called "Vinalhaven" at the left side of the layered bedrock
exposure seen at upper left in <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01642/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_543263205EDR_F0612740NCAM00312M_.JPG" target="_blank">this image</a>.&nbsp; Right Mastcam will image Vinalhaven and coarse material to the
right of that bedrock block, at targets named "Rindgemere" and "Hurd
Mountain."&nbsp; Then Right Mastcam will image more distant targets, with a
3x1 mosaic of a layered rock about 11 meters away dubbed "Saint Daniel"
and a 28x1 mosaic of the hematite-bearing "Vera Rubin Ridge" in the
distance.&nbsp; This latter mosaic is the first half of a long-baseline stereo
observation that should allow the topography of Vera Rubin Ridge to be
measured more accurately than is possible using standard Mastcam stereo
images.&nbsp; The long baseline will be achieved by moving the rover between
Mastcam observations.&nbsp; </p><p>Another drive is planned for
Sol 1643, followed by the standard post-drive imaging plus Left Mastcam
imaging of the arm workspace to support possible contact science in the
next plan.&nbsp; Later in the afternoon, Navcam will search for dust devils
and clouds, and ChemCam will again use AEGIS to autonomously select a
target and acquire data.&nbsp; </p>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff" target="_blank">Ken Herkenhoff</a>

look good, and the dust cover is working properly, so MAHLI is ready to
return to nominal operations!&nbsp; The tactical planning team therefore
selected contact science targets on a block right in front of the rover
that shows interesting color variations.&nbsp; This bedrock block is too
close to the rover to allow ChemCam data to be safely acquired, so a
nearby exposure was selected for an analogous measurement and
named "Hurricane Mountain."&nbsp; I helped plan ChemCam observations today,
and picked a nearly-vertical layered bedrock target that we called
"Hardwood Mountain."&nbsp; Right Mastcam will image these targets and take a
4x3 mosaic of another <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01632/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_542390881EDR_F0611908NCAM00354M_.JPG" target="_blank">bedrock block</a>

of images of "North Haven," a collection of pebbles near Hurricane
Mountain, and survey the sky in the afternoon.&nbsp; Then MAHLI will take 5
images of "Canada Falls" from various distances before the APXS is
placed on the first of 3 closely-spaced Canada Falls targets.&nbsp; After
sunset, APXS data will be gathered on all 3 spots, using the arm to reposition the instrument between integrations.&nbsp; <br><br></div>Early on
Sol 1635, Navcam will search for clouds and Mastcam will measure the
dust in the atmosphere.&nbsp; Later in the day, more drill diagnostic tests
are planned, followed by another set of Mastcam dust observations.&nbsp; Then
the rover will drive toward the nearby dune and acquire data that will
be used to select a target for the next drive, which will hopefully
position the rover well for contact science on the dune sand.&nbsp; <br><br></div><p>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff" target="_blank">Ken Herkenhoff</a></p>

lead!&nbsp; The MAHLI image through the closed dust cover that was planned
for Sol 1630 was successfully acquired, so we're planning to acquire a
similar image of the APXS target "Spring Point" on Sol 1632.&nbsp; MAHLI
diagnostic images of its calibration target and more drill diagnostic
tests are also planned for Sol 1632, along with ChemCam and Right
Mastcam observations of Spring Point and a nearby target named "Nine
Lake."&nbsp; Right Mastcam will also take an image of a laminated rock dubbed
"Grand Pitch" before the rover drives away.&nbsp; <br><br></div><div>On Sol

we put together another plan full of good science! The exciting news from the weekend
plan is that the MAHLI dust cover closed as planned, so we’re back in business
with MAHLI. </p>
<p>The Sol 1630 plan will start with ChemCam observations of a
vein called “Temple Stream”, a soil target called “Mattawamkeag”, and the
bedrock target “Vassalboro” to coordinate with an APXS observation of “Sangerville”.
MAHLI will also observe Sangerville, and Mastcam will document each of these
targets. After that, the plan is to drive about 40 meters and collect some
post-drive imaging.</p>
<p>Since we’re driving on sol 1630, sol 1631 will be dedicated
to untargeted science. ChemCam has an AEGIS observation, as well as some
calibration observations. This will be followed by Navcam and Mastcam atmospheric
observations, including several observations to watch for dust devils.&nbsp;</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px;"><span style="font-size: 14.72px;">by&nbsp;</span><a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://www.ryanbanderson.com/">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p>

In the afternoon, we’ll close the MAHLI cover and run a few more diagnostics.&nbsp; The second sol starts with an early science block for environmental monitoring, including Navcam and Mastcam observations to look for clouds and monitor the amount of dust in the atmosphere.&nbsp; Later in the day we’ll use Navcam to search for dust devils.&nbsp; Then Mastcam will acquire a large mosaic of the stratigraphy exposed beneath the hematite ridge, and ChemCam will target “Thorofare” to assess the composition of veins in the local bedrock.&nbsp; We’ll also acquire a long distance ChemCam RMI mosaic to monitor the slope of Mt. Sharp and look for changes.&nbsp; Throughout the first and second sols, we’ll continue to take Mastcam images to monitor changes in sand movement. Then Curiosity will drive further to the south, and take post-drive imaging to prepare for targeting next week.&nbsp; The third sol is devoted to a few more environmental monitoring activities, an autonomously selected ChemCam target, and some ChemCam calibration activities.&nbsp; Looking forward to driving again and getting a new view!</p>

Then Navcam will look for dust devils and clouds, in response to orbital observations that suggest recent increasing atmospheric opacity.&nbsp; On the second sol, Mastcam will acquire a multispectral observation on “Dunn Brook,” and will be used to document the previous APXS locations at “Tomhegan” and “Waweig.”&nbsp; We’ll also acquire a Mastcam image for deck monitoring to assess the movement of fines, and an upper tier Navcam mosaic to enable us to target features on Mt. Sharp.&nbsp; The second sol includes a number of environmental monitoring observations, using both Mastcam and Navcam to monitor the color and opacity of the atmosphere and search for dust devils.&nbsp; The plan also includes an APXS thermal characterization test and a number of change detection observations.</p><p>For more on Curiosity’s recent findings, check out this <a href="/news/2017/martian-winds-carve-mountains-move-dust-raise-dust" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>By Lauren Edgar</p><p>--Lauren is a Research Geologist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the MSL science team.</p>

We received a bit more data than expected before planning started, but
not enough to finalize drive plans and contact science targets.&nbsp; As
expected, we received more data during planning, including color images
of the arm workspace that were very useful in selecting contact science
targets.&nbsp; The late arrival of the necessary data caused delays in the
standard uplink planning timeline, but the tactical team did a great job
and we have an excellent weekend plan.&nbsp; It's good to see REMS extended
blocks back in the plan after the successful software upgrade.&nbsp; <br><br></div>On
Sol 1614, ChemCam and Right Mastcam will observe bedrock targets named
"Columbia Falls," "Spider Lake," and "Loon Stream."&nbsp; Mastcam will
measure dust in the atmosphere and acquire a 3x3 mosaic of a layered
block dubbed "Aroostook River."&nbsp; Late that afternoon, MAHLI will image
the REMS UV sensor and acquire mosaics of another bedrock target named
"Chain Lakes" and of Spider Lake.&nbsp; The APXS will then measure the
chemistry of the Spider Lake area at overlapping locations to look for
spatial variations in composition.&nbsp; Early the next morning, Mastcam will
again measure dust in the atmosphere and Navcam will search for
clouds.&nbsp; Later on Sol 1615, more drill diagnostic tests are planned,
then the APXS will be placed on its calibration target for an overnight
integration.&nbsp; A short drive to the dark dunes south of the rover is
planned on Sol 1616, followed by unstowing the arm and post-drive
imaging.&nbsp; Another busy (sometimes hectic) day for me as SOWG Chair!<br><br></div><p>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff" target="_blank">Ken Herkenhoff</a></p>

<div>After a 23-meter drive on Sol 1611, MSL again ended up in an area with many bedrock blocks partly covered by dark sand.&nbsp;
We're planning two sols today to get a head start on planning for the
holiday weekend, with the first sol strategically planned to allow the
"touch and go" option.&nbsp; But there's a ridge about 30 meters ahead that
we can't see over, and we would like to be able to drive up onto it on
Sol 1612 to allow a drive past it to be planned this weekend.&nbsp; There
isn't enough time before the "decisional" telecommunications opportunity
to fit both contact science and a 30-meter drive into the plan, so we had to pick one of these two options.&nbsp; Based on images taken from orbit
and by the rover, lots of bedrock is exposed at the crest of the ridge
30 meters away, so we picked the longer drive at the expense of contact
science today, hoping that the rover will be in a better place for contact
science this weekend.&nbsp; Before the drive, ChemCam and Right Mastcam will
observe a bright/dark boundary on a block at the left side of the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01611/opgs/edr/ncam/NRB_540510728EDR_F0610648NCAM00375M_.JPG" target="_blank">image
above</a> (dubbed "Frenchville"), and Right Mastcam will acquire a 2x2 mosaic
of another block named "Third Lake."&nbsp; After the drive, we're planning
fewer images to support weekend planning because the expected downlink
data volume is much less than usual.&nbsp; We therefore spent more time than usual
carefully prioritizing the post-drive images for downlink, and may not
receive all of the data we need to plan contact science and a drive this
weekend.&nbsp; <br><br></div><div>Later in the afternoon of Sol 1612,
ChemCam will again use AEGIS to autonomously select a LIBS target and
acquire a 3x3 set of chemical measurements.&nbsp; The REMS software upgrade
went well, so REMS environmental monitoring is being planned again today!&nbsp; On
Sol 1613, ChemCam will acquire passive calibration data, and Navcam will
search for dust devils and clouds.&nbsp; Finally, the rover will sleep
overnight in preparation for what we hope will be a busy weekend plan.&nbsp;

potential targets</a>, so the planning team spent some time discussing
priorities.&nbsp; A dark patch of bedrock, appropriately named "Patch
Mountain" was chosen for ChemCam, Right Mastcam, and MAHLI
observations.&nbsp; The MAHLI imaging was moved after the ChemCam observation
so that the LIBS impact spots would be visible.&nbsp; An additional MAHLI
image was added to the standard full suite, to provide a 3-image mosaic
from 5 cm.&nbsp; Then the rover will drive again, and take images afterward
to enable planning more activities on Sol 1612.&nbsp; Just before sunset,
Navcam will search for dust devils and REMS will complete the second
part of their flight software update.&nbsp; <br><br>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff" target="_blank">Ken Herkenhoff</a></p>

<div>The activities planned for Sol 1609 went well, and MAHLI focus data
indicate that high-resolution images of Perry were successfully
acquired.&nbsp; So we're ready to drive away from Ireson Hill after some more
remote sensing of the rocks in front of the rover.&nbsp; The Sol 1610 plan
starts with some more drill diagnostic tests, then the arm will be moved
out of the way for remote sensing.&nbsp; ChemCam and Right Mastcam will
observe a bedrock exposure named "Fogelin" that shows <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01608/mcam/1608ML0082200050505577E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">subtle color

1609 data were returned during planning this morning, the Mastcam team
noticed that the Right Mastcam image of Edmunds was blocked by the arm,
so this activity will be repeated on Sol 1610 with the arm out of the
way.&nbsp; Mastcam will also measure dust in the atmosphere before the drive
and standard post-drive imaging.&nbsp; Later in the afternoon, Navcam will
search for dust devils and clouds, and ChemCam will acquire some

<div>MSL drove a little over 9 meters on Sol 1608, to get the vehicle
closer to Ireson Hill and the dark blocks that have rolled down from the
top of the hill.&nbsp; Two of these blocks are within reach of the arm, but
both are challenging targets.&nbsp; Even the name chosen for the dark block
at the left side of <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01608/opgs/edr/ncam/NRB_540251172EDR_F0610252NCAM00353M_.JPG" target="_blank">the image above</a>
is difficult: "Passagassawakeag."&nbsp; It's pointier that we would like for
contact science, and the other dark block, dubbed "Perry" (at lower
right in the image above), is close enough to the rover that there is a
risk of collision with the arm.&nbsp; Complicating the plan further, the best
time to take MAHLI images of these targets is late in the afternoon,
when they won't be shadowed by the arm.&nbsp; But the last chance to send
data to Earth in time to make them available for planning <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">tomorrow</span></span>
is earlier in the afternoon, making it difficult to return all of the
data needed to respond to a possible arm fault.&nbsp; Therefore, we decided
to acquire a single MAHLI image of Passagassawakeag from a safe distance
of 5 cm before the critical communications opportunity, and send it in
case the full suite of MAHLI images of Perry planned later in the
afternoon is not successful.&nbsp; We would then be better able to plan
contact science on Perry <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">tomorrow</span></span> if necessary.&nbsp; <br><br></div><p>The
Sol 1609 plan starts with ChemCam and Right Mastcam observation of
Passagassawakeag, a typical Murray bedrock exposure named "Spurwink,"
and a more distant dark block called "Wassataquoik" (another
tongue-twister).&nbsp; Then the Right Mastcam will acquire a 3x1 mosaic of
the Perry area, single images of rocks near the top of the hill named
"Gonic," "Kineo," and "Edmunds," followed by an 8x4-frame mosaic of the
right side of the hill. Just before the MAHLI imaging of Perry, a full
suite of MAHLI images, plus extra stereo frames, is planned on
Spurwink.&nbsp; After all of the MAHLI activities have been completed, the
APXS will be placed on Perry for a pair of short integrations, then
placed on Spurwink for an overnight integration.&nbsp; Of course we are
hoping that this complicated plan goes well! </p><p>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff" target="_blank">Ken Herkenhoff</a></p>

Mastcam had a whole series of images of nearby sand formations. Once that was

half of the campaign to study the “Bagnold Dunes”. The Sol 1602 plan starts off
with two Mastcam mosaics of the dunes which will be repeated several times later
in the sol to watch for changes. Navcam also has a dust devil monitoring
observation in the morning science block. Around midday, Mastcam will do a
couple of measurements to determine the amount of dust in the atmosphere, and
ChemCam will do an active LIBS observation of the soil target “Mapleton” as the
final step in the diagnostics that will allow it to return to active duty! In
addition to change detection, Mastcam has a stereo image of some bedforms at “Flume
Ridge,” a 9x2 mosaic of the interesting nearby dune field, and a 3x2 observation
in support of the campaign to watch for dust devils. Later in the sol, MAHLI
will have a field day, observing the targets “Scarboro”, “McKenny”, “Matagamon”,
“Flume Ridge”, “The Forks”, and “West Branch”. The rest of the sol involves
repeating the Mastcam change detection observations, going all the way until
7:30 in the evening.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px;"><span style="font-size: 14.72px;">by&nbsp;</span><a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://www.ryanbanderson.com/">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p>

watch for dust devils, Mastcam will collect mosaics of the targets “Cape Elizabeth”,
“Mount Battle”, “Mount Blue”, and “Hematite Ridge”. After that, APXS will
measure the composition of “Cape Elizabeth” and MAHLI will take supporting
pictures. Once the arm activity is done the rover will drive about 30 meters,
squeezing between a couple of large rocks, toward some bedrock that looks good
for more contact science. After the drive, we’ll do some post-drive imaging.</p>

<div>MSL drove another 13 meters on Sol 1585, again placing the rover in a good position for contact science.&nbsp;
But the telemetry also showed that ChemCam had been marked "sick," so
we will not be able to use ChemCam this weekend while the problem is
diagnosed.&nbsp; The weekend plan is still pretty full, though!&nbsp; First, on
Sol 1586, Right Mastcam will acquire small mosaics of nearby rocks named
"Bell Brook," "Blind Brook," and "Beck Pond," then Left Mastcam will
take another image of the rover deck to look for changes in the dust and
sand on the deck.&nbsp; The rover will rest until late that afternoon, when
the illumination will be good for MAHLI imaging.&nbsp; MAHLI will take a
single image before the DRT is used to brush off a bedrock target dubbed
"Belle Lake," then take a full suite of images (plus extra stereo
images) of the brushed spot.&nbsp; MAHLI will also acquire a full suite of
images of another bedrock target called "Bluffer Pond" before the APXS
is placed on the same target for a short integration.&nbsp; Just before <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">midnight</span></span>,
the APXS will be placed on Belle Lake for a longer integration.&nbsp; On Sol
1587, the arm will be retracted and stowed to allow Mastcam to acquire a
full multispectral set of images of Belle Lake.&nbsp; Navcam will search for
dust devils before the next drive.&nbsp; In addition to the standard
post-drive activities, the arm will be unstowed to allow Navcam to take
stereo images of the new arm workspace.&nbsp; MARDI will take images during
twilight on Sols 1587 and 1588 to look for any changes due to winds.&nbsp;
Navcam will again search for dust devils on Sol 1588, and CheMin will
perform some maintenance activities overnight.&nbsp; <br><br></div><p>by<a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff" target="_blank"> Ken Herkenhoff</a></p>

<div>MSL drove almost 30 meters on Sol 1576, stopping in a location with a nice <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01576/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_537410481EDR_F0600396NCAM00375M_.JPG" target="_blank">exposure of bedrock</a> in the arm workspace.&nbsp;
MAHLI's optics look clean, so we planned a full suite of MAHLI images
and a short APXS integration on a bedrock target named "Mansell
Mountain."&nbsp; Fitting the remote sensing observations we wanted, along
with the contact science and a ~46-meter drive, into the Sol 1577 plan
was a challenge.&nbsp; But the tactical team did a great job, working
together to put together an excellent plan.&nbsp; After the contact science
is completed, ChemCam and Right Mastcam will observe an odd cobble
called "Ames Knob" and a bedrock target dubbed "Day Mountain."&nbsp; Left
Mastcam will acquire a 2-image mosaic of the bedrock slab in front of
the rover, and Right Mastcam will take an image of the Sol 1576 AEGIS
target and a 4x1 mosaic of a layered exposure named "Appleton Ridge."&nbsp;
After the drive and the post-drive imaging needed to plan Sol 1578
activities, Navcam will acquire a panorama and search for dust devils
and clouds.&nbsp; It's been a busy day for me as SOWG Chair!<br><br></div>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff" target="_blank">Ken Herkenhoff</a><div class="ajU yj6qo"><div id=":350" class="ajR"><img class="ajT" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif" alt=""></div></div>

<p>MSL planning started 2 hours later than usual today because the Sol 1575 data needed for planning weren't expected until almost 10 AM PST.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the news was not good:&nbsp; An arm fault prevented the MAHLI
full suite from completing, leaving the camera <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01575/opgs/edr/fcam/FRB_537309558EDR_F0600180FHAZ00190M_.JPG" target="_blank">close to the surface</a> with its dust cover open.&nbsp;
The remote science and drive that were
planned to follow were also precluded.&nbsp; Fortunately, this fault has occurred before and is well understood, but recovering from the anomaly
made for a rather hectic day for me as SOWG Chair!&nbsp;
The first order of business was to get MAHLI into a safe configuration,
so the Sol 1576 plan starts with a single MAHLI image to look for
evidence of dust on the exposed optics.&nbsp; Front Hazcam images will be
taken before and after MAHLI is retracted from the
surface, then Right Mastcam will take a picture of MAHLI's optics,
again to look for dust contamination.&nbsp; Finally, the MAHLI dust cover
will be closed and APXS placed on Dorr Mountain for a short
integration.&nbsp; The arm will then be stowed and Right Mastcam
will acquire a 5x1 mosaic of a distant mesa named "Lobster Mountain."&nbsp;
ChemCam and Right Mastcam will observe Dorr Mountain and a bedrock
target dubbed "Parkman Mountain," and Left Mastcam will take another
image of the rover deck to monitor changes in the
dust and sand on the deck.&nbsp; Mastcam will also measure the amount of
dust in the atmosphere before the drive is attempted again.&nbsp; We don't
expect as much data as usual in time for planning the next Sol, so we
had to carefully prioritize the post-drive imaging,
which includes another Navcam stereo pair of the arm workspace.&nbsp; Later
in the Sol, ChemCam will autonomously observe a target selected by the
AEGIS software.&nbsp; Finally, the rover will recharge overnight to get ready
for more fun on Sol 1577.</p>

<p>MSL drove nearly 17 meters on Sol 1571, to a location with <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01571/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_536965838EDR_F0600000NCAM00353M_.JPG" target="_blank">bedrock outcrops</a> in the arm workspace.&nbsp;
So the weekend plan includes lots of arm work as well as remote
observations.&nbsp; On Sol 1572, MAHLI will take images of the <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00526/mhli/0526MH0003430000201119C00_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">REMS booms</a>
to diagnose recent problems with the wind sensors.&nbsp; <span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Some of the wind sensors on one boom have not functioned since landing, and sensors on the
other boom have been acting up lately</span>.&nbsp; Later that afternoon, MAHLI will take a couple images of a
yellow/red color boundary at "Greenstone" and a full
suite of images of a yellow bedrock target named "Isle Au Haut."&nbsp; The
APXS will then be placed on Isle Au Haut for an overnight integration.&nbsp;
Early on the morning of Sol 1573, Navcam will search for clouds and
Mastcam will measure the amount of dust in the
air by imaging the Sun and the distant crater rim.&nbsp; These dust
measurements will be repeated at two other times of day later that sol.&nbsp;
Later that morning, ChemCam will acquire passive (no laser)
observations of its calibration target.&nbsp; Then the arm will go
to work again to perform new diagnostic tests of the drill feed
mechanism, to help us understand whether the drill feed stall is more sensitive to rotary-only or percussive
drilling.&nbsp; The test data
acquired to date indicate an <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/12/29/internal-debris-may-be-causing-problem-with-mars-rovers-drill/" target="_blank">intermittent problem</a> with the
internal brake within the motor that feeds the drill forward and
backward relative to the rest of the turret.&nbsp;
Fortunately, we
are able to do everything except drilling while the investigation
continues, but the team has decided not to try again to drill at
Precipice, and to continue driving up the flank of
Aeolis Mons ("Mount Sharp").&nbsp;
</p><p>After
the drill tests, ChemCam will perform some more calibration activities,
and acquire LIBS data on Greenstone and a bedrock exposure called
"Birch Harbor Mountain."&nbsp; The Right Mastcam
will then image these targets and bright vein targets dubbed
"Tarrantine" and "Flying Mountain."&nbsp; On Sol 1574, ChemCam and Right
Mastcam will observe Isle Au Haut before the rover drives away.&nbsp; After
the drive, the arm will be unstowed and Navcam will take
a stereo pair of images of the arm workspace to set us up for possible
contact science on Sol 1575.&nbsp; It will be another busy weekend for our
intrepid rover!</p><p>

to more drill diagnostics, ChemCam has a long-distance RMI mosaic of “Ireson
Hill”, as well as two additional observations of the target “Blue Hill”.

<p>Unfortunately,
the much-anticipated rotary-only drilling experiment did not even start
due to a drill fault that is currently being investigated.&nbsp; This type
of drill fault appears to be unrelated to
the previous short circuits during
percussion, but more study is needed.&nbsp; So the tactical planning team
had to scramble to put together a plan while the drill experts work to
recover from this anomaly.&nbsp; Luckily, the fault did not preclude
non-drilling arm activities, so we picked the bright
target "<a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01529/soas/rdr/ccam/CR0_533227275PRC_F0592830CCAM02528L1.PNG" target="_blank">Thomas Bay</a>"
for contact science.&nbsp; We were also able to fit a lot of remote science
observations into the plan:&nbsp; A Navcam cloud movie, a Right Mastcam
mosaic of "Squid Cove," Mastcam measurements of dust in the atmosphere,
and a small Mastcam stereo mosaic of "Baldwin
Corners."&nbsp; At various times of day, Navcam and Mastcam will image the
ground toward and opposite the azimuth of sunset to measure the
photometric (light scattering) properties of the rocks and soils near
the rover.&nbsp; ChemCam and the Right Mastcam will also
observe bedrock target "Compass Harbor" and vein targets "Bartlett
Narrows" and "Birch Point."&nbsp; After drill diagnostics are performed, more
Mastcam dust measurements and images of "Hulls Cove" and "Big Heath"
are planned.&nbsp; It was a busy day for me and the
other MAHLI uplink leads, as we had to modify our command sequences to
take images with MAHLI's dust cover closed and find the best time to
take images in full sunlight.&nbsp; Since the fine-grained Sebina sample was
dumped, we are concerned about material blowing
onto MAHLI's lens and sticking to it.&nbsp; Finally, the APXS will be placed
on Thomas Bay for an overnight integration.&nbsp;

so on Sol 1536 we will test the ability of the drill to

<p>The
current drill campaign continues to go smoothly, and the Sol 1535 plan is
dominated by an experiment to see if any Sebina sample material is left inside the
drill bit chamber from the previous drilling.&nbsp; This is motivated by the
fact that we only used vibration to transfer that sample from the drill bit
assembly into CHIMRA, rather than also using percussion.&nbsp; So it’s a
“cross-contamination experiment” designed to see if the vibration didn’t do a
complete job back when we first drilled Sebina.&nbsp; Lots of images of
the sieve and other parts of CHIMRA will be taken to verify that the system is
clean.&nbsp; These activities will take a fair amount of time and power, but we
were able to squeeze a few remote science observations into the plan:&nbsp;
ChemCam will shoot its laser at bedrock targets named "West Tremont"
and "Eastern Head," and the Right Mastcam will image the same
targets.&nbsp; The Left Mastcam will also examine <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01526/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_532962849EDR_F0592830NCAM00654M_.JPG" target="_blank">fracture patterns</a>

for some Navcams of Mt. Sharp in the Sol 1531 science block to enable some long
distance RMI observations next week. After the science block, the rover will do
the “pre-load test” on our drilling target to improve the accuracy of the drill
next week. Precipice will also be brushed off, and APXS will settle in for an
overnight measurement.</p>
<p>On Sol 1532, Mastcam starts off with an observation of the
distant foothills of Mt. Sharp, multispectral imaging of the Precipice target
(along with the associated calibration target), and imaging of the rover deck to
watch for changes in the sand and dust that have collected there. Mastcam will
also take a stereo image of the location where the previous drill sample will
be dumped. ChemCam has an observation of a target called “Breakneck Pond” which
will then be documented by Mastcam. We will round out the science block with
Mastcam and Navcam atmospheric observations. Finally, on Sol 1533, we will dump
out our previous drill sample and do an APXS measurement on the dump pile.</p>
<p>While the rover is busy with all of that, the Americans on
the MSL team will be celebrating Thanksgiving, and thinking about how thankful
we are that we get to work on such an amazing project with such great
colleagues!</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;"><span style="font-size: 14.72px;">by&nbsp;</span><a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://www.ryanbanderson.com/">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p>

have a three sol plan today as we head into the long holiday weekend and
prepare for drilling next week. </p>
<p>On Sol 1528, Mastcam has a 3x10 mosaic to provide context
for the drill site, followed by ChemCam images of the drill bit and a MARDI twilight
image of the ground beneath the rover. On the following sol, Navcam and Mastcam
start the day with a set of atmospheric observations to watch for dust devils and
measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere. After that, ChemCam has a passive
sky observation, followed by active measurements of the targets “Thomas Bay”, “The
Anvil”, and “The Ovens”. Mastcam then has a change detection observation on the
targets “Hulls Cove” and “Big Heath” along with documentation of the ChemCam
targets, including the AEGIS target from sol 1526. Mastcam and Navcam will then
repeat some of the atmospheric observations from the morning.</p>
<p>In contrast to our busy Sol 1529, sol 1530 will be
relatively quiet, with a focus on downlinking data and our normal background
data collection from REMS and DAN.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px;"><span style="font-size: 14.72px;">by&nbsp;</span><a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://www.ryanbanderson.com/">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p>

<p>The plan starts with a couple of Navcam and Mastcam observations to monitor the opacity of the atmosphere and search for clouds.&nbsp; Then we’ll acquire ChemCam observations of “Ironbound Island” and “Goat Trail” to assess the composition of the bedrock. The plan also includes several Mastcam mosaics to characterize the geometry of this deposit and document its sedimentary structures.&nbsp; In the afternoon Curiosity will acquire MAHLI images of “Ironbound Island” to characterize the more typical Murray bedrock in this area, followed by an overnight APXS integration on the same target. On the second sol Curiosity will drive toward the next drill target as we continue our systematic campaign of sampling the Murray formation. After the drive we’ll take post-drive imaging, including workspace imaging to prepare for upcoming contact science and characterizing the intended drill site.&nbsp; We’ll also take a ChemCam AEGIS observation on the second sol.&nbsp; In addition to all of these activities, the rover will perform a SAM atmospheric observation to look for methane.&nbsp; Quite the weekend for Curiosity!</p>

drives interspersed with plenty of good science. In the Sol 1516 plan, we
started off with a Mastcam mosaic of “West Mesa” to study the stratigraphy,
followed by a big 5x5 point ChemCam analysis on the nodular target “Ship
Island” which brings ChemCam to more than 400,000 laser shots! ChemCam also
analyzed the target “Stave Island” and Mastcam documented both targets as well
as the auto-targeted location from Sol 1514. Mastcam rounded out the science
block with a small mosaic of some interesting dark rocks. After that, Curiosity
drove, and ChemCam did another auto-targeted observation. Sol 1517 was pretty
simple, with a Mastcam image of the rover deck, Navcam atmospheric monitoring,
and a twilight MARDI image.</p>
<p>The Sol 1516 drive brought us to a sandy location, so the
Sol 1518 plan takes advantage of that location to study the sand. The plan
starts out with Mastcam observations to monitor the amount of dust in the
atmosphere, followed by ChemCam observations of “Folly Island”, “Burnt
Porcupine”, “Hadley Point”, and “Old Whale Ledge”. Mastcam will document all of
those targets, plus the AEGIS target from Sol 1516. Mastcam also has an
observation to extend the mosaic of the workspace. With the remote sensing
done, MAHLI will image “Folly Island” and the sandy targets “Sheep Porcupine”
and “Bald Porcupine”. APXS will also measure Sheep Porcupine and Bald
Porcupine. Late in the day, Mastcam will repeat the observations of atmospheric
dust.</p>
<p>On Sol 1519, we have a short drive with the usual post-drive
imaging, and ChemCam will do another automated observation. Sol 1520 is an
untargeted Sol, so we are focusing on imaging distant targets. Mastcam has a
mosaic of the upcoming “Hematite Ridge”, ChemCam has a long-distance RMI of Mt.
Sharp, and NavCam will look to the northern horizon to measure the dust in the
atmosphere.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px;"><span style="font-size: 14.72px;">by&nbsp;</span><a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://www.ryanbanderson.com/">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p>

science, and focused instead on remote observations.&nbsp; Planning is
restricted, so we are planning 2 sols today.&nbsp; On Sol 1509, Navcam will
search for dust devils and ChemCam will acquire passive spectra of
"Ellsworth," another target in the area about 500 meters away where
orbital data indicate the presence of clay minerals.&nbsp; ChemCam and the
Right Mastcam will also observe a nearby sand target named "Sand Beach,"
a vein target called "The Triad," and a typical bedrock target dubbed
"Rum Island."&nbsp; The Right Mastcam will then acquire a 5x1 mosaic of
Ellsworth and "McFarland Hill" and a 3x1 mosaic of nodule-rich bedrock
at "Connors Nubble."&nbsp; A 4x1 Left Mastcam mosaic is also planned, to
survey nearby sedimentary structures and nodules.&nbsp; The rover will drive
again later that afternoon, and images will be acquired to set us up for
contact science (including brushing) this weekend.&nbsp; ChemCam will then
observe a target selected using AEGIS, and CheMin will perform another

1502 is to have another pretty typical remote sensing and driving sol. The Sol
1502 plan starts out with ChemCam observations of the bedrock target “St.
Saveur” and an interesting transition between light-toned and dark-toned
alteration called “The Tam”. Mastcam will document those two targets, and then
collect mosaics of two Murray bedrock targets “Cranberry Island” and “Otter
Cliff”. After that, Navcam and Mastcam have some observations to continue
monitoring the amount of dust in the atmosphere, and Mastcam will also add to
the Sol 1501 drive direction mosaic. After that, Curiosity has a short drive
that should put us in position on a small hill, followed by some post-drive
imaging.</p>

<p>Today’s plan is another remote sensing and driving sol.&nbsp; The plan begins with ChemCam observations of “The Bubbles” and “The Bowl” to characterize the local Murray bedrock.&nbsp; Then we’ll acquire Mastcam mosaics of “Gilmore Peak” and “Long Pond” to assess some possible cross-stratification in the Murray formation.&nbsp; After another drive to the south, we’ll acquire post-drive imaging, which includes Navcam and Mastcam drive-direction mosaics (with some additional frames to capture more of the “Gilmore Peak” outcrop), a Navcam mosaic of the ChemCam targetable region, a Mastcam clast survey, and a standard MARDI image for documentation of the terrain below the rover. Overnight, Curiosity will carry out a CheMin analysis of the “Sebina” sample.<span style="font-size: 0.92em;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Today’s plan is focused on targeted remote sensing and driving.&nbsp; The morning science block includes ChemCam observations on the targets “Ranaka” and “Seleka” to assess the composition of the local bedrock.&nbsp; It also includes several Mastcam mosaics to investigate sedimentary structures.&nbsp; Then we’ll aim to drive for about 30 m to continue working our way up Mt.

showed that the Quela dump pile had been moved by the wind again!&nbsp; The
MAHLI team is concerned that windblown sand and dust might damage or contaminate the
camera's optics, so they decided to open the MAHLI dust cover only for
images taken from 25 cm or more above the surface.&nbsp;
Otherwise there are no concerns and a full drill hole is planned at
Sebina on Sol 1495, with close-up MAHLI images taken through the dust
cover window.&nbsp; As usual, the other MSL cameras will take images of the
drill hole after the arm is moved out of the way.&nbsp;
The drill sample will then be processed and transferred to the scoop
for inspection by the Left Mastcam.&nbsp; It's a full plan that again
requires significant power, but the tactical team was able to squeeze in
a few change-detection images to watch for further
changes in the dump pile.</p><p>

of the pile.&nbsp; After looking at more of the recent images, it became
clear that the dump pile had been moved by winds!&nbsp; So we put together
plans to repeat the ChemCam passive observation and APXS integration on
the dump pile at its new position, but ultimately were not able to fit
the ChemCam passive into the plan due to power limitations.&nbsp; We didn't
want to put off the strategically-planned cross-contamination
experiment, which requires significant power.&nbsp; Hopefully the wind won't
blow away the dump pile before APXS can measure its chemical
composition!<br><br></div>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff" target="_blank">Ken Herkenhoff</a><div class="ajU yj6qo"><div id=":2s9" class="ajR"><img class="ajT" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif" alt=""></div></div>

We’ll also acquire two Mastcam mosaics to characterize the lamination style in the Murray. Then we’ll drive to the intended drill location, and take post-drive imaging to prepare for contact science and drill activities.&nbsp; We’ll also squeeze in a ChemCam calibration activity in the afternoon.&nbsp; Sol 1490 will be relatively quiet, with a Navcam observation to look for clouds above the north rim of the crater and a MARDI image to document the terrain post-drive.&nbsp; We’re keeping it light on data volume to prepare for all of the drill activities later this week.</p>

way for ChemCam and Right Mastcam observations of Oodi and nearby
bedrock targets "Calenga" and "Caconda."&nbsp; The Right Mastcam will also
acquire images of targets dubbed "Chitembo," "Chingufo," and "Chipindo"
to investigate sedimentary structures in more detail, and of the rock
that AEGIS selected for autonomous ChemCam chemical measurements.&nbsp; Then
Mastcam will measure dust in the atmosphere before the next drive and
the usual post-drive imaging.&nbsp; Overnight, CheMin will analyze the Quela
drill sample again, to improve the quality of mineralogical
measurements.&nbsp; On Sol 1481, Navcam will search for clouds, AEGIS will
autonomously select a target for ChemCam observations, and the results
of the CheMin analysis will be read out of the instrument to the rover computer.&nbsp; Finally,
SAM will perform a maintenance activity before the rover gets some
sleep and recharges her batteries in preparation for the next 2-sol
plan.<br><br></div>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff" target="_blank">Ken Herkenhoff</a><div class="ajU yj6qo"><div id=":1wa" class="ajR"><img class="ajT" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif" alt=""></div></div>

slow but steady progress over rough terrain toward our next drill location. We
should get there by next weekend!</p>
<p>Today’s plan starts off with a bunch of remote sensing on
Sol 1477. Navcam has an atmospheric observation, followed by ChemCam analysis
of the targets “Chadibe”, “Bobonong”, and “Dukwi”. Mastcam will document those
targets once ChemCam is done with them, as well as the ChemCam AEGIS target
from yesterday. Mastcam also has a small mosaic of the target “Etsha” to study
its fine-scale layers, and a larger mosaic to extend the drive-direction pan
from Sol 1475. The Etsha mosaic will be repeated again later in the day. In the
evening, APXS will analyze the chemistry of the target “Caugula” and “Catumbela”
will be analyzed overnight. We will brush the dust off of Catumbela before the overnight analysis, and MAHLI will
take images of the targets to support APXS.</p>
<p>On Sol 1478, ChemCam has observations of Catumbela and “Francistown,”
with Mastcam support. Later in the day, ChemCam will do an automatically
targeted AEGIS observation and MARDI. Sol 1479 will be full of routine
engineering activities, so we didn’t plan any science blocks.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://www.ryanbanderson.com/">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p>

The primary goal for Sol 1474 is to characterize the cross-bedding and
measure grain sizes using MAHLI, and we were able to squeeze in a lot of
other good observations.&nbsp; Before the arm is deployed, ChemCam will
measure the chemical composition of the "Kopong" bedrock target, Mastcam
will acquire mosaics of the Kopong outcrop and a couple of blocks behind
it, and Navcam will search for clouds.&nbsp; The arm activities start with a
full suite of MAHLI images of Kopong and a MAHLI mosaic of the left side
of the outcrop, dubbed "Utuseb."&nbsp; Then the DRT will be used to brush
off the "Jwaneng" target, with MAHLI images taken before and after the
brushing.&nbsp; The APXS will be placed 0.5 centimeter from the center of the
brushed spot for a short evening integration, then moved to the center
of the brushed spot for an overnight integration.&nbsp; Finding good contact
science targets that could be safely brushed and imaged was a challenge,
but the tactical team did a great job, making it an easy day for me as

This should put us in front of a small exposure of cross-bedding for contact science in tomorrow’s plan.</p>
<p>I was GSTL today, and after we decided to keep driving, the planning day was pretty straightforward.&nbsp; We’re in late slide sols, so we got a late start to allow time for more data to come down. &nbsp;The plan includes several ChemCam observations to characterize the composition of the local bedrock and soil.&nbsp; We also planned a number of Mastcam mosaics to document some potentially coarser-grained rocks, sedimentary structures in the rocks in our workspace, and a linear feature that we can compare with observations from orbit.&nbsp; Then we’ll drive toward our intended contact science target, and take post-drive imaging to prepare for the activities tomorrow.&nbsp; As our SOWG Chair pointed out, today marks the first day of Curiosity’s second Extended Mission, so it’s exciting to think about what we’ll accomplish in this next chapter!</p>

parameters.&nbsp; We're planning two sols today, and our top priority is to
finish up our investigation of the Quela drill hole and tailings before
driving away.&nbsp; There are a lot of measurements
we'd like to make here, so it was a rather busy day for me as SOWG
Chair.&nbsp; After retracting and stowing the arm to allow remote sensing
observations of the Quela area, the Right Mastcam will image the imprint
of the APXS contact sensor in the drill tailings,
to determine exactly where the APXS was placed.&nbsp; Mastcam will also
image the unsieved sample dump pile through all filters and measure the
amount of dust in the atmosphere (a "Mastcam tau") by imaging the Sun.&nbsp;
Then ChemCam will go to work, acquiring passive
spectra of the dump pile and active LIBS observations of the drill
hole/tailings, a vein target named "Sumbe," and Goantagab again to look
for changes.&nbsp; The Right Mastcam will then acquire a 5x8 mosaic of the
right side of the butte in front of the rover and
take pictures of the ChemCam targets.&nbsp; Another Mastcam tau is scheduled
late in the afternoon, followed by CheMin and SAM engineering
activities.&nbsp; Mastcam will measure dust in the atmosphere again on the
morning of Sol 1468, and Navcam will search for clouds
overhead.&nbsp; A ~90-meter drive is planned during the middle of the day,
followed by the usual post-drive imaging to set us up for the next

But the team did a great job putting together a full weekend plan.</span></p>
<p>The first sol starts with several Navcam observations to search for dust devils and monitor the atmosphere.&nbsp; Then we’ll acquire a Mastcam mosaic to document the beautiful buttes that we’ve been driving through, followed by ChemCam observations of the targets “Benguela” and “Gabela” to assess the composition of the local bedrock.&nbsp; Later in the afternoon we’ll take two more Mastcam mosaics of the buttes under better lighting conditions.&nbsp; Overnight, Curiosity will carry out a SAM methane experiment.&nbsp; On the second sol we’ll take a 360-degree Mastcam mosaic to document the geology as we drive through the Murray Buttes.&nbsp; On the third sol we’ll drive, followed by standard post-drive imaging for targeting and context.&nbsp; After a busy weekend, the fourth sol is devoted entirely to REMS observations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the buttes are beautiful, they pose a challenge to communications, because they are partially occluding communications between the rover and the satellites we use to relay data (MRO and ODY), so sometimes the data volume that we can relay is pretty low.&nbsp; But it’s a small price to pay for the great stratigraphic exposures and gorgeous view!</p>

but were concerned that they would not be very useful if the surface as
dusty as it typically is.&nbsp; We therefore considered using the ChemCam laser to
clean off some of the dust and get chemical information before deploying
the arm, but recognized that the MAHLI targets would be partly shadowed
by the arm turret, which would make the MAHLI images more difficult to
interpret.&nbsp; Adding the arm activities would also leave less time for
driving, so we had a lot of trade-offs to consider and it was a busy day
for me as SOWG Chair!&nbsp; We finally decided not to include the MAHLI
images in the plan, and focus instead on Mastcam imaging of the nearby
buttes and maximizing the drive distance.&nbsp; We were also able to fit
ChemCam and Mastcam observations of the "Luxilo" bedrock target into the
plan, along with Right Mastcam images of the "Caxito" laminated
exposure and the Sol 1446 AEGIS target.&nbsp; After the drive and usual
post-drive imaging, SAM will clean its scrubber overnight.&nbsp; On Sol 1449,
Mastcam will again measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere and
ChemCam will autonomously perform another AEGIS activity.&nbsp; <br><br></div><p>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff" target="_blank">Ken Herkenhoff</a></p><p><small><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></small></p>

<div>The MSL activities planned for last weekend went well, and the
rover's batteries have enough energy to proceed with another drive on Sol 1446.&nbsp;
We started the day looking at the beautiful new Mastcam images of the
<a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01441/mcam/1441MR0071280310702898E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">nearby buttes</a>,

Mastcam will extend coverage of previously-planned mosaics,
and ChemCam will use its laser to measure the chemistry of "Muchinda"
on a <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01441/mcam/1441ML0071270070602637E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">large outcrop block</a>.&nbsp;
After the drive, ChemCam will autonomously make another observation
using the AEGIS software.&nbsp; Overnight, CheMin will prepare and analyze an
empty sample cell in anticipation of a new drill sample.&nbsp; Early on
Sol 1447, Mastcam and Navcam will measure the dust in the atmosphere and
search for clouds.&nbsp; Most of these observations will be repeated just
before local <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">noon</span></span> and late in the afternoon to look for short-term changes.&nbsp; <br><br></div><p>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff" target="_blank">Ken Herkenhoff</a></p><p><small><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></small></p>

drive and collect post-drive imaging, followed by an untargeted science block
with Mastcam and Navcam atmospheric observations. CheMin will also be doing its
third analysis of the “Marimba2” drill sample and then reading out its data to
be downlinked.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://www.ryanbanderson.com/">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p>

really enjoying the spectacular scenery because it means there is a lot of
interesting geology on display! In the afternoon on Sol 1434, we will check out
the rover’s wheels with MAHLI. On Sol 1435 Curiosity will drive about 65 meters

I helped select ChemCam targets again this morning, and was glad to see
that some of them made it into the weekend plan.&nbsp; The primary
constraint on planning today ended up being power--we tried to fit more
into the plan than the rover's batteries could support!&nbsp; But we were
still able to include a lot of good activities into the plan, starting
with a dust devil search, dust opacity measurements, and Mastcam stereo
mosaics of the Murray Buttes on Sol 1429.&nbsp; ChemCam will acquire LIBS
data on bedrock targets "Matala," "Cazombo," and "Ondjiva" before the
Right Mastcam takes a 7x3 mosaic that includes the ChemCam targets.&nbsp;
Overnight and into the early morning hours of Sol 1430, SAM will perform
the first part of an experiment on the Mojave drill sample that has
been stored in the instrument for several months.&nbsp; The second part of
the SAM experiment is planned for the next night, completing early on
Sol 1431.&nbsp; Finally, a drive is planned for Sol 1431, followed by
acquisition of the data needed to plan another drive <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">on Monday</span></span>.&nbsp; So, even though we had to remove some activities during planning, the rover will be very busy this weekend!<br><br></div><p>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff" target="_blank">Ken Herkenhoff

science observations was constrained by the time available before the
drive, so only one LIBS measurement is planned, on a <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01427/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_524176913EDR_F0561326NCAM00275M_.JPG" target="_blank">bedrock target

receive in time for planning <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">tomorrow</span></span>
is more limited than usual, so we are unlikely to receive enough
post-drive data to plan both contact science and a drive this weekend.&nbsp;

but the new drill sample was not transferred to CHIMRA due to a
recurrence of the electrical short in the percussion mechanism.&nbsp;
Therefore, the sample was not delivered to CheMin as planned.&nbsp; So we
tried again on Sol 1425, this time without percussion (using
only more gentle vibration).&nbsp; This made for a rather busy day for me as
SOWG Chair, but once the engineering team decided that it was safe to
proceed, planning went very smoothly.&nbsp; We were able to add some remote
science observations before the sample transfer
and dropoff to CheMin:&nbsp; Mastcam will take images of the drill tailings
through all filters, ChemCam will acquire passive spectra of the new
drill tailings and the sieved Oudam sample pile, and a LIBS observation
of the drill hole wall.&nbsp; CheMin will analyze
the Marimba drill sample overnight, then Mastcam will measure the dust
in the atmosphere early on the morning of Sol 1426.&nbsp;

<p>I was the GSTL today, and it was a complicated morning as we worked through several options for today’s plan.&nbsp; We decided to stick to remote sensing today while we continue to evaluate the drill activity and options moving forward.&nbsp; The GEO group decided to take advantage of the shallow drill hole as a way to assess variations in chemistry with depth.&nbsp; So we planned some Mastcam multispectral and ChemCam passive observations of the drill tailings, as well as a ChemCam LIBS observation across the drill hole.&nbsp; The plan also includes a ChemCam observation of “Cabinda” to assess an alternative drill site, as well as the target “Epukiro” to investigate an interesting vein.&nbsp; We’ll also use Mastcam and ChemCam to assess the post-sieve dump piles from the previous drill target “Oudam,” which we dumped on a nearby rock slab.&nbsp; Then Curiosity will use Mastcam and Navcam to monitor the atmosphere and search for dust devils.&nbsp; In the afternoon, we’ll acquire a 360-degree Mastcam mosaic to provide geologic context for this drill site.&nbsp; I’ll be on duty again tomorrow, hoping to pick back up with drilling activities!</p>

observe bedrock targets "Chibia" and "Dondo."&nbsp; Mastcam will also measure
the dust in the atmosphere and take an image of the Sol 1414 ChemCam
AEGIS target.&nbsp; Then the arm will be deployed for lots of contact science
and standard images of the wheels.&nbsp; MAHLI will take pictures of Chibia
before the DRT is used to brush it off, then take lots of stereo images
of the brushed spot.&nbsp; MAHLI will also acquire a full suite of images of
Dondo before the APXS measures its elemental chemistry.&nbsp; After sunset,
the APXS will be placed on Chibia for an overnight integration.&nbsp; Early
on Sol 1417, Navcam will search for clouds and dust devils, Mastcam will
again measure atmospheric dust, and ChemCam will measure atmospheric
chemistry.&nbsp; The bump to the potential drill targets will be followed by

<div>MSL is making good progress, driving almost 68 meters last
weekend.&nbsp; We had the option of taking some MAHLI images on Sol 1412, but
decided to maximize the drive distance instead.&nbsp; Before the drive,
ChemCam and Mastcam will observe bedrock targets "Jamba" and "Huambo"
and the Right Mastcam will acquire a 3-image mosaic of a small
depression called "<a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01410/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_522674200EDR_F0560462NCAM00266M_.JPG" target="_blank">Mungo</a>."&nbsp; After acquiring the post-drive imaging needed to plan future mobility, ChemCam will use<a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1925" target="_blank"> AEGIS </a>to autonomously select a new target for a LIBS raster.&nbsp; Early the next
morning, Navcam will search for clouds and dust devils, and Mastcam will
measure the dustiness of the atmosphere.&nbsp; The dust measurements will be
repeated at noon and mid-afternoon to look for changes during the day.&nbsp;
The Right Mastcam will also acquire a 14-image mosaic of the Murray
Buttes early in the morning, and we finally were able to plan the
long-distance RMI mosaic!&nbsp; The tactical team did a great job of planning
today, so it has been a relatively easy day for me as SOWG Chair.<br><br></div><p>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff">Ken Herkenhoff</a></p><p><small><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></small></p>

the interesting blocky deposit “Bimbe”. Sol 1409 starts off with a couple of
Mastcam images: one of the target “Seeis” and another of the AEGIS target from Sol
1406. Mastcam also has a mosaic to provide more context for the Bimbe blocks.
After that, ChemCam has observations of the targets “Seeheim”, “Wilhelmstal”, “Oranjemund”,
and “Seeis”. MAHLI then will observe several Bimbe targets, and APXS will
analyze two targets: “Funda” and “Zambezi”.</p>
<p>On Sol 1410, ChemCam has an observation of the target “Mariental”
with support from Mastcam. After that, we drive and do the usual post-drive
imaging. On Sol 1411, Mastcam has an observation of the rover deck to watch for
dust and sand that end up on top of the rover. Originally the plan also had the RMI
mosaic that I’ve been trying to acquire as well, but it had to be pulled from
the plan yet again to save on data volume. I am starting to think this
observation is cursed! I’ll have to try again next week.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p>

this week, planning two days at a time. Monday’s planning for sols 1405-1406 started
off with a discussion of whether we wanted to do some brief contact science
before driving, or just drive straight for the block deposit called “Bimbe”. </p>
<p>In the end, we decided to keep the contact science in the
plan, so sol 1405 included some MAHLI imaging of the target “Guri”. Mastcam had
a multispectral observation of Guri as well as “Galo” to look for evidence of
hematite. Mastcam also had an observation of an outcrop of possible
conglomerate rock. ChemCam had measurements of the bedrock targets “Cela” and “Dala”.</p>
<p>After that we drove toward Bimbe. On sol 1406, we had a Navcam
atmospheric observation and a ChemCam AEGIS target. I also advocated for a long-distance
RMI mosaic on sol 1406 to make up for the one that was lost when the rover went
into safe mode, but the orientation of the rover after the drive made it
difficult so it ended up being pulled. (It would have caused ChemCam to slew
past the path of the sun in the sky while focused, and we like to avoid any
risk of pointing the telescope at the sun). So I’ll have to advocate for that
observation some other time.</p>
<p>The sol 1406 drive went perfectly, so this morning we found
ourselves in an awesome place to study the blocks and conglomerates at “Bimbe”.
Sol 1407 starts with ChemCam observations of the targets “Lucala”, “Cabamba”,
and “Bungo”, followed by a Mastcam stereo mosaic of the Bimbe rocks. MAHLI then
has several observations of the workspace and a closer look at the target “Sonneblom”,
and APXS has an overnight observation of Sonneblom.</p>
<p>On Sol 1408, we have a morning block of atmospheric
observations from NavCam and Mastcam, followed by a Mastcam multispectral
observation of the target “Tumba” and stereo mosaics of the southern part of
Bimbe as well as some rocks in an area called “Balombo”. ChemCam will also
observe Sonneblom and Balombo.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p>

with a long science block. This was originally split into two blocks, but
during planning we decided it would save some time to combine them. Mastcam
starts the block off with a multispectral observation of the brushed target “Outjo”.
Then ChemCam has a long distance RMI observation of Mt. Sharp, plus analyses of
the targets “Outjo” and “Luanda”. After ChemCam, Mastcam turns back on, and has
mosaics of “Bukalo” and “Bailundo” (blocky deposits), “Keetmanshoop” (an
outcrop of Murray formation), and “Quimavongo” (a small crater). SAM will also
continue its sample analysis.</p>

post-drive imaging. And then in the early morning on Sol 1392, Navcam and
Mastcam have a series of atmospheric observations.</p>

are planning two sols today and three sols tomorrow. We only had a couple of Navcam
images on the ground this morning to help us choose targets, but we still
managed to find two targets for ChemCam to analyze on Sol 1387: a rock named “Noordoewer”
and a soil named “Savates”. Mastcam will document those targets and take a nice
mosaic of the “Murray Buttes”. After that, we have a short drive, followed by
post drive imaging. I dialed in to planning this morning and requested some
Navcam of Mt. Sharp along with the post drive imaging to help target more long
distance ChemCam RMI images. On Sol 1388, we have an easy day: ChemCam has a
calibration observation and Navcam has a couple of atmospheric monitoring
observations.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p>

<p>Contact
science in the Sol 1380-1381 plan went well, so we're back to driving in the
weekend plan!</p>
<p>Sol 1382
will start with a Mastcam video of Phobos crossing in front of the sun, plus a
multispectral observation of the brushed target “Koes”. ChemCam will then
analyze the targets “Koes,” “Kongola,” and “Rundu” and Mastcam will document
those observations. After that, we will drop off some of the “Oudam” sample to
SAM for analysis.</p>
<p>On Sol
1383 the rover will drive and then collect the usual post-drive images,
including an 8x1 mosaic along the side of the rover to study changing textures
as we drive. We’ll also take some extra Navcam images of a crater in the
distance. Later in the day, Mastcam has a couple of atmospheric observations
and ChemCam has an auto-targeted observation.</p>
<p>The
weekend plan is only two sols since Sunday is a “soliday” allowing Earth and
Mars schedules to get back in sync. But the plan does include an early morning
science block for Sol 1384 to collect some atmospheric observations with Navcam
and Mastcam.</p>

the details of the stratigraphy there, as well as some atmospheric
observations. After that, the plan is to drive for about 70 meters and collect

nothing jumping out at us as a contact science target where we stopped, in
today’s plan we will try to make up for some of the lost distance from the

<p>The Sol 1373 drive
completed successfully, moving the rover over 31 meters toward the
south.&nbsp; There's lots of bedrock exposed around the vehicle, but no flat
patches large enough to brush in the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01373/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_519391997EDR_F0543036NCAM00353M_.JPG" target="_blank">arm workspace</a>.&nbsp;
So MAHLI will take images of an unbrushed target called "Andara" before
the APXS is placed on it for an overnight integration.&nbsp; Before these
arm activities on Sol 1375, ChemCam and the Right Mastcam will observe
Andara and other bedrock targets "Okoloti,"
"Kalkfeld," and "Khorixas."&nbsp; Mastcam will then acquire a stereo mosaic

CheMin team requested another portion of the Oudam drill sample, which
will be delivered late that afternoon.&nbsp; After dark, MAHLI will image the
CheMin inlet using its LEDs for illumination.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Late in the morning of
Sol 1376, APXS will integrate again on Andara to compare the quality of
data acquired at different temperatures.&nbsp; Then the arm will be stowed
for a long (about 55 meters) drive, which will
be followed by the usual post-drive imaging and another ChemCam AEGIS
(autonomously-targeted) observation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>On Sol 1377, the Left
Mastcam will acquire a mosaic of the rover deck, to serve as a baseline
for comparison with future images taken after passing the sand dunes
along the path ahead.&nbsp; Sand blown across the
rover might remove some of the dust on the rover deck.&nbsp; Finally, CheMin
will analyze the new Oudam sample portion overnight.&nbsp; It should be
another busy weekend for MSL!</p><p>

<p>The two-sol plan starts off with ChemCam and Mastcam observations of the Oudam drill hole and tailings, and the nearby target “Omulonga.” We’ll also acquire some Mastcam and Navcam observations to monitor the atmosphere.&nbsp; In the afternoon of the first sol, we’ll use the DRT, MALHI and APXS to characterize the bedrock target “Aubures” to look for variations in texture and chemistry within the Murray formation.&nbsp; On the second sol we’ll acquire a 360 degree Mastcam mosaic for geologic context, and a routine SAM electrical baseline test to monitor instrument health.&nbsp; Hopefully the Navcam images will be retransmitted so we can continue with our drill site characterization activities later this week!<span style="font-size: 0.92em;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<div><div>The Oudam drill campaign continues to go well, with sample
acquired and ready for analysis.&nbsp; Planning is now restricted, so we are
planning 2 sols today.&nbsp; On Sol 1364, ChemCam will acquire passive

hole.&nbsp;
Later that afternoon, the unsieved portion of the drill sample will be
dumped on the ground and imaged by MAHLI from 25 cm to support future
planning.&nbsp; After dark, MAHLI will take pictures of the inside of the
drill hole, the tailings, and the CheMin inlet using its LEDs for
illumination.&nbsp; The APXS will then be placed on the drill tailings for an
overnight integration.&nbsp; <br><br></div>Early on Sol 1365, the Right
Mastcam will extend the mosaic of Hartmann's Valley, adding 22 images.&nbsp;
That afternoon, the APXS will be retracted and vibrated to clean it,
then the arm will be moved out of the way for ChemCam and Mastcam
observations of the drill tailings.&nbsp; Navcam will search for clouds both
near the horizon and at zenith.&nbsp; Finally, CheMin will analyze the drill
sample overnight.<br><br></div><p>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff">Ken Herkenhoff</a></p><p><small><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></small></p>

<div>The MSL Rover Planners have all the data they need to drill (no
"mini-drill" required), so the plan for this weekend focuses on drilling
into the Oudam bedrock target.&nbsp; The full drill is scheduled for Sol
1361, followed by MAHLI and Mastcam images of the new hole.&nbsp; The rover
will then rest until Sol 1362, when the drill sample will be transferred
to the scoop for Mastcam imaging and sieved.&nbsp; A fine-grained (&lt;0.15
mm) portion of the sample then will be dropped into CheMin for an
overnight mineralogical analysis.&nbsp; After the CheMin data are read out of
the instrument on Sol 1363, Mastcam will take a multispectral set of
images of the drill tailings and a Right Mastcam mosaic of an <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01360/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_518230185EDR_F0542280NCAM00286M_.JPG" target="_blank">outcrop

sample analysis is the focus of the Sol 1360 plan.&nbsp; First, CheMin will
dump the Lubango and Okoruso drill samples out of their cells.&nbsp; Then
ChemCam and Mastcam will observe a bright vein named "Charlottenfelder"
and a bedrock target called "Chameis Bay" before arm activities resume.&nbsp;
MAHLI will take close-up images of the <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01359/mhli/1359MH0004650010502127C00_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">Oudam drill target</a>
and a single image of the "footprint" that APXS likely made on the
Okoruso dump pile yesterday.&nbsp; Overnight, CheMin will analyze an empty
cell to provide a baseline measurement before receiving the new drill
sample.&nbsp; Early the next morning, before handover to the next plan,
observations of the Sun and sky will measure dust in the atmosphere over
the rover and search for clouds and dust devils.&nbsp; The Right Mastcam
will take a 10-image mosaic of the "Otjizonjati" outcrop <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01357/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_517962226EDR_F0542280NCAM07753M_.JPG" target="_blank">northwest of

patch of the Murray formation, putting us in a good position for a very busy
holiday weekend! On Sol 1355, ChemCam has observations of the targets “Auchas”,
“Kaisosi”, “Inamagando”, and “Horingbaai”. Mastcam will document those targets
and then do some multispectral observations of the targets “Kunjas” and “Navachab”,
plus a mosaic of the contact between the Murray and Stimson units. Navcam will
round out the science block with some atmospheric observations. </p>
<p>Sol 1356 was an unusual one, with a bunch of small science
blocks spread throughout the day. These were to enable a series of measurements
leading up to a coordinated set of observations in the afternoon between the
instruments on the rover on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. (Yes,
this means a new HiRISE image of Curiosity is coming soon!) </p>
<p>First thing in the morning on Sol 1356, Mastcam and Navcam
have a photometry observation. This is repeated a few hours later along with a
multispectral Mastcam observation of the target “Inamagando”. A few hours
later, the photometry observation is repeated again (the idea is to see how the
brightness changes as the sun angle changes) and ChemCam has a passive sky
observation. Finally, there is another photometry observation, a Mastcam “sky
survey” observation, and Mastcam “sky flats”. These are followed by a
long-distance ChemCam RMI image that I managed to squeeze into the plan. I am
hoping that the similar time of day (and therefore similar lighting) will make
it easier to compare the HiRISE and RMI images. After the RMI, Sol 1356 will
wrap up with one final photometry observation.</p>
<p>On Sol 1357 we will drive again, followed by standard
post-drive imaging. This plan will take us through the long weekend, so our
next planning day will be on Tuesday.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><span style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;</span><a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p></div>

data from MSL early this morning.&nbsp; To my dismay, the post-drive images
that we expected to receive in time for planning today were not
available!&nbsp; It turned out that the data were received on Earth, but the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter operations team had some problems processing and transferring it to us.&nbsp; We waited as long as we could for the data needed
to plan contact science or mobility activities, then decided that we
should plan Sol 1350 without them because planning time is limited by
the early uplink window--we have to have the plan
ready to send to the rover by this evening.&nbsp; Fortunately, the images
needed to pick remote sensing targets were processed in time to point
ChemCam and Mastcam at the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01349/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_517255082EDR_F0541610NCAM00353M_.JPG" target="_blank">outcrop in front of the rover</a>.&nbsp;
Planning targeted remote sensing is much easier than planning contact
science or mobility, so the Sol 1350 plan includes ChemCam/Mastcam
observations of "Oamites," "Aruab" and "Hosabes" as well as Mastcam
images of the Sun and distant crater rim and Navcam
searches for clouds and dust devils.&nbsp; Mastcam will also acquire
calibration data at various times of day (temperatures), and CheMin will
perform another analysis of the Lubango drill sample.&nbsp;

location with a view of the rugged ridges of the area we’ve been calling “Fracture
Town”. In fact, from our current location, we decided that those ridges may be
a bit too rough for comfort, so we are planning a slight change in course that
will take us a bit south of our original path. The new path should be smoother
and will also give us a better view of the contact between the Stimson and
Murray units.</p>
<p>But before we set off on this revised path, we have some
science to do at our current location! On Sol 1348, ChemCam has observations on
the targets “Meob”, “Nomeib”, and “Munutum”. Mastcam will take documentation
images of these targets as well as the one observed by ChemCam using AEGIS
after our last drive. Mastcam will also observe the targets “Hudoab”, “Witputz”,
“Sandamap”, plus a mosaic of Fracture Town. Once the remote sensing is done, we
will brush off the target Meob, taking MAHLI images before and after. MAHLI
will also take some images of the target Nomeib. That will be followed by a
quick APXS observation of Nomeib and an overnight observation on Meob.</p>
<p>On Sol 1349 we have some more targeted science! ChemCam will
observe targets “Annental” and “Nainais”, and in addition to documentation
images of those targets, Mastcam will also do a multispectral observation of
Meob. Navcam has an atmospheric observation as well. After that, the rover will
drive and do standard post-drive imaging, plus a ChemCam AEGIS observation and
a MARDI image of the ground beneath us.</p>

The plan for Sol 1346 starts off with ChemCam observations of the targets “Etusis”
and “Etiro”, to continue measuring the variations in silica abundance around
large fractures. Mastcam has a context image of these two targets, plus a
mosaic looking ahead to an area we’ve been calling “Fracture Town”. After that,
the rover will drive and do standard post-drive imaging, plus CheMin will do
another analysis of the Okoruso sample.</p>
<p>On Sol 1347, the rover has a number of atmospheric
observations, plus a ChemCam observation using the AEGIS software to target a
nice patch of bedrock automatically. This is a new capability, and it’s really
nice to be able to get some data after we drive without having Earth in the
loop!</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><span style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;</span><a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p>

<div>The drive planned last weekend completed successfully, moving MSL
less than 6 meters into position for contact science on the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01342/opgs/edr/ncam/NRB_516627956EDR_F0540992NCAM00376M_.JPG" target="_blank">rocks broken
by the rover wheels</a>.&nbsp;
Planning is restricted this week, so we are planning 2 sols' worth of
activities.&nbsp; The first sol (1344) includes a "touch and go" that
requires extra Rover Planner staffing, as both arm activities and a
drive are planned.&nbsp; It's great to be able to do so much in one plan, but
we had to cram a lot of stuff into Sol 1344 because the drive
has to be completed before the afternoon MRO communications relay to
allow another drive to be planne<span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">d on Wednesd</span></span>ay.&nbsp;
So we had to decide which scientific observations were most important
and work to fit them into the plan.&nbsp; I helped select a target for a
ChemCam observation of "Impalila," one of the freshly-exposed rock
surfaces, and was glad to see that it made it into the plan.&nbsp; Mastcam
will acquire a multispectral observation of the broken rocks before
MAHLI takes pictures of "Stampriet," Impalila, "Narubis," and
"Swartmodder."&nbsp; As I mentioned in my previous blog, it's difficult to
get MAHLI close to these targets, so the camera will be placed no closer
than 5 cm from any of the targets; we can't get any closer than 25 cm
to Swartmodder.&nbsp; After MAHLI imaging is completed and the arm stowed,
the rover will drive toward the west, hopefully getting back to the Sol
1311 location, where the rover was before we decided to return to the
Lubango area.&nbsp; <br><br></div><div>Sol 1345 observations cannot be
targeted because they will be taken after the drive, so ChemCam and
Mastcam will perform routine sky measurements.&nbsp; That's it!</div><div></div><p>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff">Ken Herkenhoff</a></p><p><small><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></small></p>

rover
that we decided to investigate them instead.&nbsp; Before we could decide
whether to "bump" to the rocks that were broken when the rover drove
over them, we had to make sure they could be well imaged by MAHLI.&nbsp;
Taking MAHLI images of nearly vertical faces is difficult, because the
turret at the end of the arm must be placed close to the ground.&nbsp; While
the Strategic Rover Planner worked to find ways to get MAHLI close to
the fresh surfaces, we planned pre-drive remote sensing and arm
activities:&nbsp; On Sol 1341, ChemCam will observe its calibration target, a
bedrock target named "Kobos 3," and the wall of the Okoruso drill
hole.&nbsp; Mastcam will then provide context for the ChemCam observations
and take stereo mosaics of "Naob" and other bedrock near the rover.&nbsp;
Later that afternoon, the DRT will be used to brush dust off a brighter
layer in the bedrock, with MAHLI images taken before and after the
brushing.&nbsp; We also planned close-up MAHLI images on a nearby bedrock
target dubbed "Rooilepel" and a lower-resolution MAHLI mosaic of the
area including Mariquita.&nbsp; All of this MAHLI work made for a very busy
day for me as MAHLI uplink lead!&nbsp; <br><br></p><div>APXS will measure
the chemistry of the brush spot overnight, before another busy sol
begins.&nbsp; The arm will be stowed to allow a Mastcam multispectral
observation of the brush spot before the rover bumps over to the broken
rocks.&nbsp; During the drive, DAN will actively measure the subsurface
hydrogen content by turning on its neutron generator.&nbsp; After acquiring
post-drive images, the rover will take a nap before CheMin performs
another overnight analysis of the Okoruso drill sample.&nbsp; Early on the
morning of Sol 1343, Navcam will search for clouds and dust devils, and
Mastcam will measure the optical thickness of dust in the atmosphere.&nbsp;
Later that sol, ChemCam will use the newly-validated AEGIS software to
acquire LIBS measurements of an autonomously-selected target.&nbsp; Of
course, we are hoping that the software continues to work well!</div><div></div>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff" target="_blank">Ken Herkenhoff</a> <div class="ajU yj6qo"><div id=":2cu" class="ajR"><img class="ajT" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif" alt=""></div></div>

on the surface of Mars for two Mars years (almost four Earth years)! To
celebrate, we have a new <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1908">press
release</a> discussing our ongoing environmental measurements. These sorts of
systematic measurements become more useful the longer the rover is on the
surface to collect them, because we can compare how conditions change from year
to year.</p>
<p>Of course, we had other ways to celebrate too. Our French
colleagues at CNES (Centre national d'études spatiales) made a Mars-themed cake,
complete with a little rover exploring a delicious-looking cocoa-dusted martian
surface!</p><p><img src="http://astropedia.astrogeology.usgs.gov/downloadWeb/news/images/20160511_074816.jpg" alt="Tiramarsu cake made by our French colleagues" width="800" height="450"></p>
<p>The mission doesn’t stop for us to eat cake though. Today we
planned Sols 1339 and 1340, continuing our drill campaign at the target “Okoruso”.
On Sol 1339, MAHLI will observe a pile of drill tailings that was dumped
without being sieved. CheMin will complete the analysis from the Sol 1338 plan,
and APXS will make an overnight measurement of the dump pile. On Sol 1340, we
have a targeted science block with ChemCam passive and active observations of
the dump pile, and active observations of the targets “Kobos 2”, “Stampriet”,
and “Swartmodder”. Mastcam will document those targets, and then Mastcam and
Navcam will make some atmospheric dust observations.</p>
<p>Here’s to many more martian birthdays for our rover! We
still have a long way to go to catch up with Opportunity’s &gt;6.5 Mars years
of activity!</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;</span><a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p>

<p>Today’s two-sol plan is focused on drilling and MAHLI imaging on the first sol, with a lot of targeted remote sensing on the second sol.&nbsp; Activities on the second sol include a Mastcam multispectral observation of the drill hole, a large Mastcam mosaic to document the local geology, ChemCam observations of “Kobos” and “Strathmore” to investigate altered and unaltered rocks, and a long distance ChemCam RMI mosaic as part of a change detection experiment.&nbsp; We’ll also acquire a Mastcam tau, ChemCam passive sky, and Navcam movie to monitor the atmosphere.</p>
<p>I’m impressed by how efficient we’ve become at drilling (we just wrapped up the last drill hole a couple of sols ago).&nbsp; Sometimes I need to pause and remind myself how unique and exciting this is.&nbsp; On what seems like just a typical Wednesday, we’re drilling a hole on another planet! &nbsp;I’m grateful for the skilled operations team that makes this seem so easy, and I’m looking forward to seeing results from the newest drill hole on Mars.</p>

ready for lots of science! On Sol 1326, we started off with multispectral
Mastcam observations of the pile of dumped powder from the “Lubango” drill
target and the targets “Rubikon” and “Ebony”. Then ChemCam had a passive
observation of the dump pile, followed by active observations using the laser
on Rubikon as well as “Ida” and “Lorelei”. Mastcam documented the ChemCam
observations as usual, and then finished the science block with an atmospheric
observation. Later in the day on Sol 1326, MAHLI observed the dump pile and
drill tailings, as well as a bedrock target called “Nara Valley”. Finally, APXS
had an overnight observation of the dump pile.</p>
<p>In today’s weekend plan, which covers Sols 1327-1329, we
start off with a sol focused on dumping out more of the powder acquired from
the Lubango drill, this time after passing it through a sieve. Mastcam and
MAHLI will take pictures of the new dump location before and after the sieved
sample is dumped, and then APXS will do an overnight measurement. On Sol 1238,
we have lots of remote sensing. Navcam and Mastcam have a few atmospheric
observations, and then ChemCam will measure the pre- and post-sieve dump piles,
Nara Valley, and a target called “Ovitoto”. </p>
<p>Then, on Sol 1329, Curiosity will do a short drive to a nearby
patch of flat Stimson formation sandstone that should not have as much silica
enrichment as what we see at Lubango. This will put us in position to drill
that location sometime next week!</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p>

observation of the drill tailings at “Lubango” along with Mastcam documentation.
After that, MAHLI will take a closer look at the targets “Lianshulu” and “Rubikon”.
Other than routine environmental monitoring measurements by DAN, RAD, and REMS,
that’s about all for sol 1325! Taking it easy today allows us to do some remote

So far, all of the activities planned for last weekend have completed successfully, and we have a <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01321/mhli/1321MH0005920010500607C00_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">new drill hole</a> on Mars!&nbsp; The Sol 1323 plan is therefore to continue the Lubango drill
campaign, transferring the sample to CHIMRA, sieving it, and delivering
some of the &lt;0.15 mm fraction to CheMin.&nbsp; ChemCam will shoot its
laser at "Oshikati," a potential target for the next drilling campaign,
and Mastcam will acquire stereo images of a location that may be
suitable for dumping the Lubango sample.&nbsp; Overnight, CheMin will analyze the sample.<br>
<br>
I'm SOWG Chair today, and the only significant problem I've had to deal
with is how to fit everything we'd like to do into the available power.&nbsp;
We were able to squeeze in all of the top-priority activities, so I'm
happy with the plan!<br>

<p>I was on duty as GSTL again today, and it’s always exciting when we get to drill a new sample on Mars.&nbsp; In addition to the main drill activities, the plan includes several targeted science blocks, which will be used to characterize the drill location and search for the next potential drill site on unaltered Stimson bedrock.&nbsp; On the second sol, the science block includes Mastcam multispectral characterization of the drill hole, followed by several Mastcam mosaics.&nbsp; The color information provided by Mastcam is really helpful in distinguishing altered versus unaltered bedrock.&nbsp; We also planned a small mosaic to assess a fracture that crosscuts an impact crater.&nbsp; Then we’ll shoot several ChemCam targets to assess the block that we’re drilling, and a few sites that we might bump to next.&nbsp; The science block on the second sol includes an additional target to assess unaltered Stimson bedrock.&nbsp; Fingers crossed for a successful drilling campaign!</p>

including the full MAHLI wheel imaging and associated rover motion of
just over 1 meter.&nbsp; The science team decided to return to the <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01310/mcam/1310MR0062390000700458E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">Lubango

drilling.&nbsp; Before the drive, ChemCam and Mastcam will observe bedrock
targets "Outapi" and "Okongo," the RMI will acquire a 5x1 mosaic of
"Piambo," Mastcam will take images of the Lubango area, and Navcam will
search for dust devils.&nbsp; Active DAN measurements are planned both before
and after the drive, and CheMin will perform some calibration
activities overnight.&nbsp; I'm MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead again today, and had
only the usual MARDI twilight image to plan.<br>

Tactical planning was a bit hectic today as we reacted to yesterday's
change in the near-term science goals, but the team quickly determined
what is feasible and put together a good plan.&nbsp; There are no good
brushable targets in the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01312/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_513965186EDR_F0540388NCAM00353M_.JPG" target="_blank">arm workspace</a>, so the DRT will not be used.&nbsp; Rather, we selected 3 targets for MAHLI
imaging and APXS measurements of natural surfaces.&nbsp; I'm MAHLI/MARDI
uplink lead today, and have been very busy!<br>
<br>
The Sol 1313 plan starts with a mid-day ChemCam observation of the sky
and Mastcam images of the Sun to measure the amount of dust in the
atmosphere.&nbsp; The arm will be deployed that afternoon to take MAHLI
images of "Kasane" and "Uau," on either side of a bright/dark boundary
in the outcrop.&nbsp; MAHLI will then take pictures of another bedrock target
dubbed "Onesi" and of the rover wheels.&nbsp; The APXS will be placed on
Onesi for a couple evening integrations, then on Uau for an overnight
integration.<br>
<br>
Early the next morning, Navcam will search for clouds and Mastcam will
measure dust again by imaging the Sun.&nbsp; Later that morning, MAHLI will
take pictures of the REMS ultraviolet sensor, which is done periodically
to see how much dust is on the sensor.&nbsp; Then the remote sensing
instruments get busy:&nbsp; Mastcam will take a multispectral image of
"Gariep," a few rocks that were broken/crushed by the rover wheels, then
ChemCam and Mastcam will observe Uau, Kasane and a bedrock target named
"Kolmanskop."&nbsp; The RMI will acquire a 5x1 mosaic of Mount Sharp, Mastcam will take stereo images of the "Rasthoff" area and image the Sun again, and Navcam will search for clouds.&nbsp; Finally, the APXS will be placed on Kasane for an overnight integration, in parallel with a SAM scrubber cleaning activity.<br>
<br>
On Sol 1315, the rover will complete the full set of MAHLI wheel images,
bumping in between images to ensure that all parts of the wheels are
imaged.&nbsp; The usual set of post-drive images will then be acquired to set
us up for planning <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">on Monday</span></span>, when we will probably drive again.<br>

<p>So the modified plan for Sol 1312 includes several ChemCam and Mastcam observations to assess the composition of both altered and unaltered Stimson bedrock, and Mastcam imaging to document the fractures that run through the outcrop.&nbsp; We won’t drive, but we’ll still take images to set us up for contact science and remote sensing in the weekend plan.&nbsp; Talk about late-breaking science!</p>

started at 7 am instead of 6:30! </p>
<p>Curiosity is in good shape and our drive was successful. In
the Sol 1311 plan, we have ChemCam observations of the targets “Garnet Koppie”,
“Amspoort”, “Soutrivier”, and “Uubvley”. Garnet Koppie and Amspoort will allow
us to compare the composition of a bright fracture halo and the nearby bedrock,
Soutrivier is targeting a small white vein, and Uubvley is a fin of material
sticking up near a large fracture. ChemCam also has a long distance RMI
observation of the Peace Vallis channel off to the north. We talked a lot about
possible places to image with Mastcam, but decided that we will have a better
view of everything of interest after another drive or two, so Mastcam just has
documentation images of the ChemCam targets.</p>
<p>After the targeted observations, we have a short drive to
put the rover in a better position to see the terrain in front of it. This will
allow us to drive into the area with large fractures visible from orbit, which
we have started informally calling “Fracture Town” but which will probably get
a more official name soon. </p>
<p>The plan finished with some early morning atmospheric
observations on Sol 1312, including a ChemCam passive sky observation, Mastcam
observation of the amount of dust in the atmosphere, and Navcam movies to watch
for clouds.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status</em></p>

myself this morning that getting to help run a nuclear-powered laser-wielding
robot on Mars is worth losing a little bit of sleep every once in a while!</p>
<p>Our drive finally went according to plan, bringing us a bit
closer to the edge of the Naukluft plateau. We plan to continue driving today and tomorrow, aiming to get within reach of some interesting
large fractures that we can see in the orbital data to do contact science over
the weekend. There are also some tantalizing outcrops coming up that should
give us nice views of the stratigraphy of the Stimson unit, but they are not
quite visible yet. </p>
<p>We are only expecting to get a small amount of data
downlinked before tomorrow, so we kept today’s plan for Sol 1310 nice and
simple. In the morning, we have a ChemCam observation and Mastcam documentation
of a nearby alteration halo around a fracture, followed by a small Mastcam
mosaic of a similar bright halo and fracture at a location we are calling “Oswater”.

unfortunately the plan for the weekend was not transmitted to Mars due to a
Deep Space Network outage. That means that the contact science that was planned
for the weekend is lost, but the team decided that it was not important enough
for us to delay driving. Today’s plan attempts to at least recover the remote
sensing observations before we move on.</p>
<p>The Sol 1309 plan starts off with a continuation of the
previous mosaic of the target “Rasthof” plus a multispectral observation of the
target “Ruacana”. ChemCam then has a long distance RMI mosaic of some mesas to
the west of the Peace Vallis fan, followed by an analysis of some dark cap rock
at the target “Kapako”. Mastcam will document Kapako and finish up with a small
mosaic of some interesting textures in a nearby part of the outcrop. After
that, we have a short drive followed by standard post-drive imaging. In the
afternoon, Mastcam and Navcam have several atmospheric observations and MARDI

<p>On Sol 1305, the rover straightened its wheels in preparation for a
drive, but then the fault that prevented driving earlier this week
occurred again, and the vehicle did not move.&nbsp; The engineers are
preparing to send parameter changes that will eliminate mobility
actuator sensitivity to the transient power spikes.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, there are some <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01305/opgs/edr/fcam/FLB_513349228EDR_F0540010FHAZ00302M_.JPG" target="_blank">rocks in front of the rover</a> that are suitable for contact science, so the arm will be deployed on
Sol 1307.&nbsp; But first, ChemCam and Mastcam will examine a bedrock target
named "Divundu" and rock target "Kapako," and Mastcam will acquire a
full multispectral set of images of a <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01305/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_513343947EDR_F0540010NCAM00268M_.JPG" target="_blank">distant bright ridge</a> called
"Ruacana."&nbsp; Later that sol, MAHLI will take a couple images of Divundu
before the DRT brushes dust off of the target.&nbsp; MAHLI will then acquire a
full suite of images of the brushed spot and smaller sets of images of a
rock named "Gaio" and a bedrock target called "Lucira."&nbsp; The APXS will be placed on Gaio for a couple of evening integrations, then on Divundu for a long overnight integration.<br>
<br>
Early on the morning of Sol 1308, the Right Mastcam will acquire a
mosaic of the north side of Aeolis Mons ("Mt. Sharp").&nbsp; Later that
morning, Navcam will search for clouds and dust devils, and Mastcam will
image the crater rim to determine how much dust is in the air within
Gale crater.&nbsp; In the afternoon, the arm will be stowed before Mastcam
acquires a multispectral observation of the Divundu brush spot before
the rover attempts to drive again.&nbsp; After taking the usual post-drive
images, the rover will go to sleep and recharge its batteries in
preparation for <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Monday's</span></span> activities.&nbsp; Only 2 sols are being planned today, to get the tactical schedule back in sync with "Mars time."<br>

Once again, the Sol 1303 drive stopped during wheel steering, apparently
due to another short in the RTG.&nbsp; While the power and mobility
engineers investigate the fault and ways to respond to them, another
drive will be attempted on Sol 1305.&nbsp; The remote science observations
made on Sol 1303 went well, so only one ChemCam/Mastcam observation is
planned before the Sol 1305 drive, of a rock with <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01302/mcam/1302ML0061910720405647E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">interesting surface
texture</a> dubbed "Katwitwi."&nbsp; Early on Sol 1306, Navcam, Mastcam and ChemCam will
look for clouds and dust devils, and measure the amount of dust and
various gasses in the atmosphere.&nbsp; Later that sol, Mastcam will observe
the Sun again and Navcam will acquire a panorama of the rover deck to
look for changes in the distribution of dust and debris.&nbsp; Overnight, CheMin will analyze and empty sample cell to improve instrument calibration.<br>

The Sol 1301 drive halted after only 4.5 meters of progress, apparently
due to a short in the RTG that caused a steering actuator fault.&nbsp; This
type of fault has occurred before, so we are planning a drive<a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01301/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_512994865EDR_F0540000NCAM00266M_.JPG" target="_blank"> toward the
northwest</a> on Sol 1303.&nbsp; Before the drive, lots of remote sensing science is
planned, starting with a Right Mastcam mosaic of an outcrop toward the
southwest dubbed "Rasthof."&nbsp; Then ChemCam and Mastcam will observe
bedrock targets "Tsondab," "Omingonde," and "Marble Koppie," and Mastcam
will observe the Sun and the distant crater rim to measure the amount
of dust in the atmosphere.&nbsp; After the drive and the usual post-drive
observations, on Sol 1304 ChemCam will shoot its laser at its titanium
calibration target and Navcam will search for clouds again.<br>

the edge of the Naukluft plateau, driving across “Stimson” bedrock. The weekend
plan begins on Sol 1300 with three ChemCam observations of the bedrock target “Bero”
and fracture targets “Iona”, “and “Arco” along with Mastcam documentation. This
is followed up by some MAHLI and Mastcam images of Bero before and after
brushing off the dust. MAHLI also has some images of Gudaus and APXS will
measure the composition of Gudaus and Bero.</p>
<p>In the early morning on Sol 1301, Mastcam has 4 mosaics of various
portions of the Stimson unit. These include areas with fractures and nodules,
as well as some interesting layers in a nearby outcrop. After that, the plan is
to drive about 50 meters and collect our standard post-drive images.</p>
<p>On Sol 1302, Navcam and Mastcam have a bunch of atmospheric
observations, and ChemCam has a long-distance observation of Peace Vallis, the
large valley carved into the northern rim of the crater. Mastcam will then
round out the day with a large 360 degree panorama from our end-of-drive
location.</p>

</p><p>The Sol 1296 drive was halted after only 4 meters of progress because
the suspension on the left side of the rover was more tilted than
expected.&nbsp; Suspension checks are routinely included in drive sequences,
to keep the vehicle safe, and MSL is indeed safe.&nbsp; So the Sol 1298 plan
includes a drive to the same location as previously planned.&nbsp; We were
also able to squeeze in some pre-drive remote science:&nbsp; ChemCam and Mastcam will observe rock targets named "Blaubock 2"
and "<a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01296/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_512555645EDR_F0532644NCAM00354M_.JPG" target="_blank">Chapeu Armado</a>."&nbsp; Sol 1299 observations are untargeted because they
will occur after the drive, and include Mastcam, ChemCam, and Navcam
measurements of the sun and sky.<br>
<br>
I was MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead again today, with only the usual MARDI
twilight image to plan.&nbsp; But if the rover ends up in a good location for
contact science, we'll be able to plan MAHLI close-up images this
weekend.<br>

"Bloedkoppie," "Blaubeker" and "Blaubock," and Mastcam will acquire
mosaics of ridges and outcrops of the Stimson sandstone.&nbsp; Planning is
restricted, so we are planning untargeted remote sensing observations on
Sol 1297:&nbsp; The RMI will acquire a mosaic of a distant target toward the
northwest, Mastcam will measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere by
imaging the Sun, and Navcam will search for dust devils.&nbsp; Finally, early on Sol 1298, the Left Mastcam will acquire another mosaic of the Stimson sandstone on the Naukluft Plateau.<br>

Because the fault is understood,&nbsp;we were able to proceed with the weekend plan from our current location.</p>
<p>The first sol of the weekend plan is devoted to targeted remote sensing.&nbsp; We’ll start with some environmental monitoring observations to assess atmospheric opacity and composition. &nbsp;Then we’ll acquire ChemCam and Mastcam observations on the targets “Sesriem Canyon,” “Omaheke,” and “Varianto” to assess variations in composition and sedimentary structures in the local bedrock.&nbsp; In the afternoon, we’ll acquire a large Mastcam mosaic of Mt. Sharp, to take advantage of the low atmospheric opacity right now (which means that the conditions are great for imaging).&nbsp; The second sol is focused on contact science.&nbsp; We’ll use MAHLI and APXS to investigate two targets: “Sesrium Canyon” and ldquo;Rossing.”&nbsp; The first target exposes some nice bedding in the Stimson formation, and the second includes some interesting bright material for comparison.&nbsp; Then on the third sol, we’ll again try to drive towards the ridge to the northwest and acquire post-drive imaging for targeting.&nbsp; I hear the pot of gold lies just beyond…</p>

<p>MSL drove almost 40 meters over the rough terrain on the Naukluft

<p>The 26-meter drive planned for sol 1282 completed successfully, giving
the rover nice views of interesting features in the Stimson unit.&nbsp; Some of these<a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01282/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_511304340EDR_F0531470NCAM00354M_.JPG" target="_blank"> features appear to be the result of erosion by windblown sand</a> and are the subject of a Right Mastcam 7x2 mosaic planned for Sol 1283.&nbsp;
ChemCam will measure elemental chemistry at the edge of one of the
bedrock blocks and Mastcam will acquire another mosaic of a fracture
named "Welwitschia Wash" before the rover drives away.&nbsp; The view from
the intended location, about 40 meters toward the west, is expected to
be excellent because much of the Gale crater rim and Mt. Sharp will be visible, and the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01282/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_511304483EDR_F0531470NCAM07753M_.JPG" target="_blank">atmosphere is not as dusty as usual</a>.&nbsp; Other post-drive observations include ChemCam RMI and Right Mastcam
mosaics of features on Mt. Sharp that are so far away that they can be
targeted accurately using available image data.&nbsp; Also, the Left Navcam
will be used to search for clouds and dust devils.<br>
<br>
It was an easy day for me as MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead, as I only had to
plan the usual MARDI twilight image after the drive.&nbsp; But, as usual, it
was fun and interesting to be involved in tactical operations.<br>

so I'm getting back up to speed on recent MSL activities today.&nbsp; The
Sol 1281 drive completed as planned, crossing the Murray/Stimson contact
at the edge of the Naukluft plateau.&nbsp; Now that we have a better view of
the plateau, we are ready to start driving across it.&nbsp; But first,
ChemCam and Mastcam will observe targets "Orupembe" and "Witvlei" on the

targets "Natab East" and "Natab West" on either side of the vehicle
before the Sol 1282 drive.&nbsp; After the drive, in addition to the usual
post-drive imaging, the Left Mastcam will acquire a full 360-degree
panorama, as the view from the new location (near the left edge of the

the new data!<br>

nodules at the contact between the Murray and Stimson formations and resume
driving! </p>
<p>The weekend starts off focused mostly on contact science. On
Sol 1279, APXS will analyze two neighboring locations on a group of nodules
collectively called “Khomas”, and then on Sol 1280 APXS will analyze a third
location on Khomas. MAHLI will collect supporting images, and will also take
some pictures of the targets “Etendeka” and “Maieberg”.</p>
<p>In the morning on Sol 1280, the rover will make some
atmospheric measurements using Navcam, Mastcam, and ChemCam, followed by a 20-spot
ChemCam analysis of the target “Marienfluss”, right across the Murray-Stimson
contact. Mastcam will take a support image of Marienfluss, plus a small mosaic
of a target called “Kerpfenkliff”. </p>
<p>Then on Sol 1281, we will get moving again with a ~70 meter
drive that should take us up onto the Naukluft plateau. During the drive, MARDI
will collect some images of the terrain underneath the rover. After the drive
we have post-drive imaging, and I added a request for some Navcam images of Mt.
Sharp to help target potential long distance ChemCam RMI images next week.&nbsp;</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

go exactly as planned: it was slightly misaligned with the nodule we were
trying to analyze, so the measurement was mostly of the neighboring bedrock.
That meant planning today started with a discussion of whether the chemistry
from ChemCam was sufficient, or if we should spend another day and nail the
APXS measurement as well. In the end we decided to try again and make sure we
get all the data we want about the nodules before moving on.</p>
<p>The Sol 1278 plan starts with ChemCam analyses and Mastcam
images of the targets “Tsarabis”, “Lofdal”, “Kunene”, and “Nababis”. Mastcam
also has two mosaics to capture the contact between the “Murray” and “Stimson”
formations and the transition from knobby nodule-rich bedrock to less
nodule-rich bedrock. After that, MAHLI will collect images of the nodule targets
“Sperrgebiet”, “Maieberg”, and “Konigstein” and APXS will try again to do an
overnight measurement of the composition of Sperrgebiet. Since this is the
second try, the rover planners have yesterday’s data to work with and should be
able to place the APXS more accurately. If all goes well, we should be able to
wrap up at this location and drive away in the weekend plan!</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

for some contact science, right near the contact between the “Murray” and “Stimson”
formations, with some interesting veins and textures in the nearby rocks. Given
our nice location, we opted not to do any driving in the Sol 1275 plan and
instead study the area in front of us. </p>
<p>The Sol 1275 plan started off with a ChemCam passive sky
observation and ChemCam LIBS and RMI observations of the targets “Palmhorst”, “Palmwag”,
and “Mirabib”. Mastcam took documentation images of each of the ChemCam targets,
plus a couple of mosaics of the Murray-Stimson contact. Later in the day, MAHLI
took some images of Mirabib before and after brushing the dust off, as well as mosaics
of Palmwag and Palmhorst. APXS then analyzed the composition of Palmwag and
then did an overnight measurement of Mirabib.</p>
<p>In today’s plan, our goal is to place the rover in position
to study some interesting knobby textures. Prior to the drive, Navcam will do
some atmospheric measurements and ChemCam will analyze the targets “Duruchaus”,
“Eiseb”, and “Aranos”. As usual, Mastcam will take some documentation images of
the ChemCam targets. Mastcam also has a mosaic of fine laminations in the rock
at the Murray-Stimson contact, another mosaic to extend the coverage of the
contact, and a small 2x1 mosaic of Mirabib and nearby veins using all of
Mastcam’s science filters. After that, we will do a short drive toward the
knobby texture followed by post-drive imaging. The knobby texture is not in a
great position for us to continue driving after we analyze it, so we’ll likely
return back to our current position before continuing up onto Naukluft
plateau.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

rover will start off on Sol 1266 with ChemCam observations of the targets “Ugab”,
“Rooibank” and “Stockdale”. We will zap the Rooibank target using two different
laser energies to see if that helps us figure out the amount of hydrogen in the
target. Afterwards, Mastcam has some documentation images of the ChemCam
targets, and then we will do some contact science: MAHLI will take some images
of “Waterburg”, then the DRT will brush the dust off of “Stockdale” and MAHLI
will take some pictures of that target too. After the DRT, Mastcam will observe
the Stockdale target with all of its science filters, and APXS will then do an
overnight observation on the brushed location.</p>
<p>On Sol 1267, Mastcam has a big mosaic of the edge of the
Naukluft plateau, which will give us a nice view of the geology there and help
us decide what to do as we get closer. After that, the rover will continue
driving toward the plateau and do the usual post-drive imaging, plus some
additional Mastcam off to the right hand side of the rover.</p>
<p>On Sol 1268, we have a bunch of untargeted observations.
ChemCam has a passive sky observation, and Mastcam will observe its calibration
targets so the filter observations of Stockdale can be calibrated. Mastcam also
has tau observations at two different times. To wrap up the plan, Navcam will
do its usual atmospheric monitoring observations.&nbsp;</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

of the plateau. The Sol 1264 plan starts with some targeted science: first we
have a Mastcam mosaic of the scarp that forms the edge of the plateau, and then
ChemCam will analyze the two targets “Awahab” and “Awa Gamteb”. After the
targeted science, the rover will drive about 30 meters and do standard
post-drive imaging so we can do targeted science (and possibly contact science)
over the weekend.</p>
<p>In the early morning of Sol 1265, we have a bunch of
atmospheric observations with Navcam and Mastcam to watch for clouds and
measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere. Then later in the day Mastcam
will repeat its dust observations. I was involved in planning this morning and
we were hoping to get some long-distance RMI observations of Mt. Sharp in the
Sol 1265 plan, but they had to be removed because the software we use to write
the commands was giving different coordinates than what we were expecting from
the images. It’s always disappointing to have observations pulled from the
plan, but it’s better to be safe than sorry when you start to get weird results
from the software. Pulling them from the plan allows us to figure out what the
issue was, and we can get the images I wanted some other time.</p><br><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

ChemCam has two long distance RMI mosaics of the stratigraphy of the Peace

the camera pointing doesn’t really change much when we drive). Mastcam then has

is fine, gradually working its way around the north end of a large dune. I’m just an absent-minded blogger with too many other things going on!
</p>
<p>We started this week on Tuesday with the Sol 1256 plan. This
included some long distance ChemCam RMi images of a location on Mt. Sharp that
I have been advocating for, plus some small Mastcam mosaics of targets “Chuos”,
“Guinas”, “Aroab”, and the rover deck. This was followed by a ~30 m drive and
post-drive imaging. </p>
<p>The 1257 plan was more challenging than we would have liked
because we didn’t get the data expected from Sol 1256 due to an issue with the
Deep Space Network (the data isn’t lost, just delayed). With most of our data
missing, Sol 1257 ended up being mostly untargeted observations. ChemCam did an
RMI calibration target observation, followed by a long-distance RMI mosaic of
the Peace Vallis alluvial fan. Navcam had an atmospheric observation to look
for clouds and measure wind direction right above us. After that, the rover did
a “turn for comms” where we turn in place to improve our ability to uplink and
downlink data, followed by some post “drive” imaging. </p>
<p>On Sol 1258 we had a bunch more untargeted observations.
Navcam had several atmospheric observations, watching for clouds over Mt. Sharp
and straight above the rover, plus watching for dust devils. ChemCam had a
passive sky observation to measure the atmospheric composition, and Mastcam had
an observation of the crater rim to measure the dust in the atmosphere and a
tau measurement of the sun for a similar purpose.</p>
<p>In the second science block on Sol 1258, ChemCam repeated
the passive sky observation, and Mastcam repeated the observation of the crater
rim and the sun. These Mastcam observations were repeated one more time later
in the day to see whether the amount of dust changes with time of day. </p>
<p>For today’s weekend plan, there was some uncertainty about
whether the rover would be level enough to allow for contact science, but we
were happy to find out that it is! We start out on Sol 1259 with ChemCam
observations of the targets “Gross Aub”, “Groot Aub”, “Gorob”, and “Grosskopf”,
with Mastcam images to document. Navcam also has an atmospheric observation.
Then later in the day we will brush the dust off of the target “Gorob”, with
MAHLI images before and after. &nbsp;MAHLI
will also take some images of “Groot Aub”. APXS will then measure the
composition of “Groot Aub” and then do an overnight measurement of “Gorob”. On Sol
1260 we will drive a few meters, then take some pictures of the wheels with
MAHLI, and then continue driving for another hour or so, followed by post-drive
imaging. Finally, on Sol 1261, ChemCam will do some calibration target
observations, and Navcam has a few more atmospheric observations.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

The dune sand samples were dumped onto the ground, but it appears that the <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01251/mhli/1251MH000558001040 3821C00_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">sample</a> was partly blown by the wind.&nbsp; There is enough sample left to investigate with various instruments,<br>
so the Sol 1253 plan starts with ChemCam passive spectra and Mastcam multispectral observations of the dump piles and brushed spot.&nbsp; Later that sol, MAHLI will take pictures of the APXS calibration target and both dump piles before the APXS is placed on the pile of sieved sand for a short integration.&nbsp; After sunset, the APXS will be moved to a bedrock target named "Bergsig" for another short integration, then to the pile of unsieved sand for a long, overnight integration.<br>
<br>
The rover will wake up before dawn on Sol 1254 for an attempt to<br>
detect surface frost using ChemCam.&nbsp; This is the best time of year for<br>
water frost to form, so we're hoping that ChemCam will see the<br>
hydrogen in the water.&nbsp; Later that sol, ChemCam and Mastcam will<br>
observe the unsieved dump pile and the brushed spot, this time using<br>
ChemCam's laser to measure chemical composition.&nbsp; Mastcam will also<br>
image the frost target, the sun, and the distant crater rim to measure<br>
the amount of dust in the atmosphere.&nbsp; Then MAHLI will image Bersig,<br>
the sieved dump pile to look for the imprint of APXS's contact sensor,<br>
and the brushed spot.&nbsp; Overnight, CheMin will analyze the dune sand<br>
again, to improve the accuracy of the mineralogical measurement.<br>
<br>
Finally, on Sol 1255, the rover will drive toward the north, to get<br>
around the sand dune to the west of the vehicle.&nbsp; In addition to the<br>
usual post-drive imaging, the Navcam will take a couple images of<br>
Mount Sharp to enable planning of future long-distance imaging.<br>
Another full plan that has kept the tactical team busy today!<br>

<p>The rover has traversed over 12 km since landing, and another drive
is planned for Sol 1249.&nbsp; The tactical planning team decided to forgo
targeted remote science observations before the drive to allow more time
for driving.&nbsp; The goal
is to get the vehicle to a location that will allow the remaining dune
sample to be dumped and examined in detail this weekend, and this will
require more drive time than originally planned.&nbsp; With only a few
science observations in the plan, it was an easy
day for the team.&nbsp; I'm MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead again today, planning
another MARDI twilight image.</p><p>

It's not Groundhog Day, but the drive planned for Sol 1247 will be attempted again on Sol 1248.&nbsp; Due to a minor sequencing error, the arm activities that were planned for the morning of Sol 1247 were precluded.&nbsp; Because the arm was not stowed that sol, the drive did not execute and the rover has not moved.&nbsp; We were not able to recover the MAHLI imaging of the <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01166/mhli/1166MH0000950010402469C00_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">REMS UV sensor</a> that was planned for Sol 1247 because it will be in shadow by the time the Sol 1248 activites start at about <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">11:00</span></span>.&nbsp; So it was an easy day for me as MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead, with only a MARDI twilight image to plan.&nbsp; We were able to squeeze in some ChemCam and Mastcam observations of "Nil Desperandum" before the drive, in addition to the usual drive-related observations.<br>

<p>The 3-sol weekend plan starts by using the DRT to clear off the dust on the target “Kudis.”&nbsp; Then we’ll acquire MAHLI images of this typical Murray formation bedrock.&nbsp; Nearby, there’s an interesting patch of nodules, so the science team decided to go for a second MAHLI target named “Tinkas.”&nbsp; In addition to all of the contact science on “Kudis” and “Tinkas,” MAHLI will also be used for wheel imaging and to check out the REMS UV sensor.&nbsp; Overnight, we’ll acquire APXS data on both targets, to compare the typical bedrock composition to the nodule-rich composition.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second sol, Curiosity will wake up early for some atmospheric monitoring observations.&nbsp; Around midday, we’ll acquire Mastcam multispectral imaging of “Kudis,” followed by a ChemCam passive observation of the sky.&nbsp; ChemCam will also be used to assess the composition of typical bedrock and the nodule-rich rock, and Mastcam will document the local geology.&nbsp; On the third sol, Curiosity will drive towards the Naukluft Plateau, and acquire post-drive imaging to prepare for next week.&nbsp; Sounds like a busy weekend!</p>

<p>I was the GSTL today, and it was a pretty straightforward day.&nbsp; Due to additional CHIMRA diagnostics, there wasn’t much time for additional science.&nbsp; The plan includes turning and backing up to allow a DAN active measurement over the dune sampling location.&nbsp; In the geology theme group, we focused our attention on post-drive imaging, to prepare for the possibility of contact science or drilling in an upcoming plan.&nbsp; In addition to all of the great science on active dunes, it’s exciting to think about the bedrock and where we might drill next!</p>

there was no science involving the arm in today’s plan. Still, there was plenty
to do, and we had to be careful not to collect too much extra data because
there is a backlog of data on the rover waiting to be downlinked to Earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;On Sol 1239 we
planned a bunch of observations of a target called “Gosser Schroffenstein” in
the area called “Mniszechis Vlei” (I am really enjoying the names list lately) where
the rover’s wheel scuff in the sand exposed a tiny scarp or cliff in the sand.
This little scarp gives us a good view of the fine-scaled layering in the top
few centimeters of the dune. ChemCam will take an RMI mosaic of Gosser
Schroffenstein, followed by an active LIBS analysis targeting the face of the
scarp. After that, the RMI mosaic will be repeated to see if the laser pulses
caused any changes in the delicate sand scarp. Once ChemCam is done, Mastcam
will take a 5 image stereo mosaic of the whole Mniszechis Vlei area. Mastcam
also has another change detection observation of the target “Hebron” and Navcam
has an atmospheric observation. Once the science is done on Sol 1239, we will
do some more diagnostics on the CHIMRA. Later in the day on Sol 1239, CheMin
will analyze some of the sand that was collected previously.</p>
<p>On Sol 1240 ChemCam has a few passive (no laser) observations
of the Mastcam and ChemCam calibration targets. These are followed by a couple
of long-distance RMI mosaics of Mt. Sharp. These are observations that I have
been advocating for recently, so it was nice to be able to fit them in the plan
today while I was on duty as the ChemCam science PUL. Mastcam will take color
images to help document the long distance RMI mosaics, and will repeat the
change detection observations of Hebron a couple more times.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

The cause of the CHIMRA anomaly is still being investigated, so no arm
motion was planned today while diagnostic testing continues.&nbsp; Because
only remote science observations are allowed, it was a straightforward
day for me as SOWG Chair and for the rest of the tactical science team.&nbsp;
The only challenge was that the volume of data expected to be received
in time for planning <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">on Friday</span></span>
is less than usual because MRO is performing some planned maintenance
this week and cannot relay data from MSL.&nbsp; Fortunately, it looks like we
will be able to get all the critical data via the Mars Odyssey orbiter.<br>
<br>
In addition to the CHIMRA diagnostic tests on Sol 1237, ChemCam and
Mastcam will image the alluvial fan northeast of the rover, at the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01221/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_505898403EDR_F0521162NCAM12753M_.JPG" target="_blank">base
of the Gale crater wall</a>.&nbsp; Mastcam and Navcam will also take stereo images of the edge of the area
disturbed by the wheel scuff, named "Mniszechis Vlei."&nbsp; I don't know how
to pronounce that name, and didn't even try!<br>
<br>
The command to allow SAM to analyze the sample of dune sand was not
received, so we'll try again overnight between Sols 1237 and 1238.&nbsp; Then during the day on Sol 1238 ChemCam will observe the sky and
continue checking out new software that will allow autonomous ChemCam
targeting.&nbsp; Mastcam change detection observations of the sand dune are
also sprinkled throughout the plan.&nbsp; Finally, just after sunset the RMI
will take images of the sky for instrument calibration.&nbsp; We have been
trying to plan this observation for weeks, and were glad to be able to
include it in today's plan.<br>

<p>I'm scheduled as MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead today, and was looking forward to planning more close-up imaging as the Namib dune campaign continues.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the CHIMRA behaved in an unexpected way during processing
of the third scoop on Sol 1231, which prevented completion of the arm
activities planned for last weekend.&nbsp; While experts evaluate the
anomalous behavior and develop a recovery plan, no new <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01233/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_506961700EDR_F0521162NCAM00320M_.JPG" target="_blank">arm</a> activities
will be planned.&nbsp; So I didn't have much to do today and focused on what should be done after the anomaly is resolved.<br>
<br>
The Sol 1235 plan includes ChemCam and Mastcam change-detection images of Hebron and new observations of the scuff floor target Husab.&nbsp; In addition, ChemCam will analyze bedrock target "Etjo" and Mastcam will image CHIMRA to confirm its configuration.&nbsp; Overnight, SAM will<br>
analyze the 0.15-1.0 mm size fraction of the dune sand.&nbsp; Before dawn on Sol 1236, ChemCam will search for evidence of water frost on both fine sand and the Etjo bedrock target.&nbsp; After sunrise, the ChemCam RMI and Right Mastcam will take pictures of the same frost targets, then Mastcam and Navcam will acquire an early-morning set of photometry images.&nbsp; Later that sol, ChemCam will observe the sky and Mastcam will repeat the Hebron observation to look for changes.&nbsp; Finally, Mastcam and Navcam will repeat the photometry observation later in the morning of Sol 1237.<br>

Do” list for our stop at Namib Dune. This weekend’s plan starts on sol 1232
with a day dedicated to analyzing the sand samples with SAM. Then, on Sol 1233 we will
start off with Mastcam change detection on the target “Hebron” and then a “multispectral”
observation of the target “Hakos” using all of Mastcam’s different color filters.
Next up, ChemCam has an RMI mosaic of “Gobabeb” dump pile A and then an
analysis of the vein target “Sanitatis”. &nbsp;Next MAHLI will take a bunch of pictures of
the various dump piles and scoops in the dune.</p>
<p>On sol 1234, we have a long, busy science block full of
Mastcam and ChemCam. It starts off with Mastcam multispectral observations of
the Sanitatis vein, and of dump piles C,D,E, and F. This is followed by some
Mastcam atmospheric observations of the sun and the crater rim to help
determine the amount of dust in the atmosphere. ChemCam will then analyze dump
piles C and D, first with the laser off to get the reflectance spectra, and
then with the laser on to get chemical composition. ChemCam will also use the
laser to analyze the soil target “Dwyka” and then will finish up with a long
distance RMI mosaic of Mt. Sharp. Then we will take Mastcam images of each of
the ChemCam targets. We will finish up the science block with some photometry
images from Mastcam and Navcam to help understand how light scatters off the
Martian surface, and then some Navcam atmospheric monitoring movies. Finally,
APXS will analyze dump pile B overnight.</p>
<p>The weekend plan also includes an early morning science
block on the morning of sol 1235, which will contain more Navcam movies,
Mastcam observations of atmospheric dust, and a repeat of the photometry
experiment at a different time of day to capture a different lighting angle.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p></div>

In the sol
1230-1231 plan the main event is dropping off some sand in the SAM instrument,
but some of the other instruments got a workout too. The sol 1230 plan
originally included a science block with some ChemCam, Mastcam, and Navcam
observations, but unfortunately that had to be cut to save power, so those
observations will have to happen over the weekend. With the science block
removed, the first activity on sol 1230 is a Mastcam observation of the SAM inlet.
After this, the rover will drop off a sample of sand for SAM to analyze. Then
while the arm is active MAHLI will observe the dump piles, including some
night-time observations using the built-in LEDs to illuminate the piles.&nbsp; APXS also has a couple of overnight
measurements on two of the dump piles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 0.92em; line-height: 22.08px;">On Sol 1231, we will start off with some Navcam and Hazcam
images to document where APXS was making its measurements, plus Mastcam
observations of the SAM inlet again. This will be followed by some arm activities
to clean out the components of the sample handling system. Then we'll dive back
in and collect another scoop of material from the dune, sieve it, and deliver
it to SAM too. Finally, APXS will be placed on another of our dump piles for an
overnight measurement. And of course REMS and DAN will be collecting data each
sol of the plan as usual.</span></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

available power.&nbsp; First, MAHLI will take pictures of a couple of
locations on the dune surface that has not been disturbed by the wheels,
and of sand that was disturbed by the wheel scuff.&nbsp; Then the APXS will
be placed as close as possible to the scuffed sand for an overnight
integration.&nbsp; On Sol 1224, the scoop will be used to acquire a sample of
the undisturbed dune sand.&nbsp; This sample will be sieved and the finest
material (less than 0.15 mm diameter grains) will be dropped into the
SAM inlet.&nbsp; SAM will then analyze the sample overnight, into the wee
hours of Sol 1225.&nbsp; I'm paying close attention to planning today because

operations are back on track, with a drive to the dune sampling area

target named "Probeer" on a patch of <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01216/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_505448028EDR_F0520936NCAM00354M_.JPG" target="_blank">bedrock in front of the rover</a><a rel="noreferrer" href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01216/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_505448028EDR_F0520936NCAM00354M_.JPG" target="_blank"></a>.&nbsp; Mastcam will also image Probeer and acquire a stereo mosaic of the
nearby part of the Namib dune.&nbsp; After the drive, in addition to the
imaging planned to support arm work and targeted remote sensing, Navcam
will acquire a small mosaic of the upper part of Mt. Sharp.&nbsp; Overnight, SAM will measure the abundance of methane in the atmosphere,
then Navcam and Mastcam will look for clouds and dust early in the
morning of Sol 1222.&nbsp; Later that sol, Mastcam and RMI will image the
wall of a ~4 km-diameter crater about 30 km to the west.&nbsp; ChemCam and
Mastcam will then observe the sky, and Mastcam will acquire a small
stereo mosaic to look for changes in the nearby dune.&nbsp; Throughout the plan, REMS will measure wind speeds for comparison with any motion of sand observed by the cameras.<br>

sampling activities!</p>

<p>The plan today involved a pre-bump Mastcam mosaic for context, and some deck imaging to monitor fines.&nbsp; Then Curiosity will drive toward the sampling location, and will turn the right front wheel to create a scuff in the sand.&nbsp; After the drive we’ll take more imaging to prepare for targeting in the weekend plan.&nbsp; In the afternoon, we’ll also use Mastcam for a change-detection observation of a nearby ripple.&nbsp; I’ll be on duty again tomorrow, so I’m excited to see how the plan works out!</p>

<p>Today’s plan is a four sol Holiday plan covering Sol
1202-1205, and it will be followed by some pre-planned activities to take us
all the way until Sol 1214 and the new year here on Earth, so there’s a lot to
talk about!</p>
<p>On Sol 1202, we will first repeat the ChemCam RMI and
Mastcam change detection images that we’ve been acquiring of the nearby
dunes.&nbsp; Then the arm will finish its
sample dumping and cleaning activities, and MAHLI will take some images of the
dump pile and APXS will analyze it. </p>
<p>The following sol, we will repeat some of the Mastcam change
detection observations. Mastcam will also re-take some of the dune images from
the recent 360 degree panorama with different exposure and focus settings.
ChemCam has two laser analyses of the targets “Aus” and “Aukas” and Mastcam
will take some supporting images as always. After that, we’ll take one more
MAHLI image of the dump pile and then stow the arm.</p>
<p>Around noon on Sol 1204, ChemCam will collect some atmospheric
observations (with the laser turned off), plus observations of the “Greenhorn”
dump pile with the laser off and then with the laser on. Mastcam will also
observe the dump pile, using all of its different color filters. In the
afternoon, Mastcam will measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere by looking
at the sun, and will take some images of the rover’s deck to see if any sand
from the dunes has blown up onto it. Navcam will search for dust devils and
look at the horizon to measure the dust in the atmosphere. Next, the rover will
adjust its position slightly so that REMS can get better wind measurements and
Navcam, Mastcam, and MARDI will take the standard documentation images after
the drive. </p>
<p>Sol 1205 will be a light day. The rover will take some
measurements to update our knowledge of its tilt and orientation, and REMS will
collect atmospheric measurements.&nbsp; Sols
1206-1213 have been pre-planned and will be pretty similar to Sol 1205, with
REMS, DAN, and Mastcam environmental monitoring measurements. </p>
<p>While the rover is doing all of this, most of the rover team
will be taking some time off to spend the holidays with friends and family,

it looks like at least some of the “Greenhorn” sample was dumped before the arm
ran into difficulties.The plan for sol 1201 has a lot of diagnostics to help our engineers to better understand what happened with the arm. It is very likely that the arm hardware is OK, but the diagnostics will allow us to avoid this problem in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to arm diagnostics, we still have science to do
in the sol 1201 plan! Mastcam has a 10x2 mosaic to study the fine layers in a nearby
outcrop, and ChemCam has a 2x2 “depth profile” observation of the target
“Matchless_2”. For a depth profile, the laser fires 150 times per location
rather than just 30 times, allowing us to see how the composition changes as
the laser removes tiny amounts of material. Mastcam will take an image of
Matchless_2 after the depth profile. On Sol 1202, we have a bunch of change
detection observations of the nearby dune with Mastcam and ChemCam’s RMI.</p>
<p>Since some of the Greenhorn sample was dumped, we want to
get the arm operational again as soon as possible so that the dumped sample can
be analyzed before the martian wind blows it away. We’re hoping that will be
possible in tomorrow’s plan!</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

arm while the “Greenhorn” sample was being dumped, which caused the rover to
stop what it was doing. Because the arm ended up in an unexpected position, it
prevented the APXS and MAHLI observations from occurring as planned, and it was
in the way of the subsequent three ChemCam observations. The arm issues meant
that today’s plan was dedicated to recovering from the problem, but we managed
to include some science observations as well. </p>
<p>On Sol 1200, we have a bunch of Mastcam images. First,
Mastcam will take two images of “Hope Mine” and “Engo”, the ChemCam targets
that were automatically selected by the AEGIS software on Sol 1199. Next,
Mastcam will do a mosaic of the slip face of Namib dune, and a stereo
observation of the target “Nadas” to study the shape of the alcoves on the very
crest of the dune. Mastcam will also watch for changes in a patch of nearby
sand, as well as a couple of locations on the dune slip face. Finally, ChemCam
will do something similar, taking a large RMI mosaic on the dune target “Duineveld”
to look for any changes.</p>
<p>In the afternoon on Sol 1200, ChemCam has two observations
on targets “Matchless” (a bright vein) and “Nama” (a patch of bedrock). Mastcam
will provide supporting images for those observations as usual. This will be
followed by Mastcam, Hazcam, and Navcam images of the location where we were
expecting to dump the Greenhorn sample. We’re not sure whether the sample was
dumped before the arm halted, so these images will help to understand what
happened. </p>
<p>For sol 1201, ChemCam and Mastcam will repeat their change
detection observations, and Navcam will also do some standard observations to
look for dust devils and understand the amount of dust in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will be able to recover from the arm issue
quickly! In the meantime, we’re in a great location to study “Namib Dune” so
there is plenty of good science to be done.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p></div>

<p>Although today is a weekend plan, we’re only planning 2 sols because Sunday is a soliday (a day without planning to allow Earth and Mars schedules to sync back up).&nbsp; The main activity on the first sol is dumping the “Greenhorn” post-sieve sample and then analyzing it with both MAHLI and APXS.&nbsp; But we managed to squeeze in a lot of additional science observations into the plan, including some ChemCam RMIs of targets named “Duineveld” and “Spitzkop” to study the grain size and morphology of different parts of the slipface, and Mastcam imaging of several targets for change detection.&nbsp; We’re also testing out some software for autonomous target selection, and using Mastcam and Navcam to monitor the atmosphere.&nbsp; We’ll be in the same location for a little while, so hopefully we’ll have the chance to observe some sand movement!</p>

<p>After successfully completing a mobility test last week (as seen by our wheel tracks through this <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NLB_502692998EDR_F0511616NCAM00263M_&amp;s=1185" target="_blank">sand patch</a>), Curiosity drove ~35 m toward a dune that is now named “Namib.”&nbsp; We’ve accomplished a lot of reconnaissance imaging of the dunes, and we’re looking ahead to monitoring the dune slipface and sampling the chemistry and mineralogy of an active dune.&nbsp; We’ve also acquired some beautiful close-up images of the sand grains, as seen in the above&nbsp;<a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=1184MH0005480010402897C00_DXXX&amp;s=1184" target="_blank">MAHLI image</a> that just came down<span style="font-size: 0.92em;">.</span></p>
<p>Today’s 2-sol plan includes a targeted science block followed by a drive and post-drive imaging, and an untargeted science block on the second sol.&nbsp; Sol 1187 includes several ChemCam and Mastcam observations of the local bedrock at targets named “Rehoboth,” “Hamilton_Range,” and “Twyfelfontein.”&nbsp; We’re also testing out some software for autonomous target selection. Then we’ll drive towards the “Namib” dune and take post-drive imaging to prepare for future targeting. Overnight, Curiosity will perform a SAM Electrical Baseline Test to make sure that the power and data interfaces are all operating smoothly.&nbsp; On the second sol we’ll use ChemCam, Mastcam, and Navcam to monitor the composition and opacity of the atmosphere and search for dust devils.</p>

a very busy weekend plan studying the dune and then continuing to drive. On sol
1184 we will continue testing the AEGIS software that allows the rover to
fine-tune its targeting for ChemCam. After that, ChemCam will analyze two
targets “Barby” and “Kibnas” and Mastcam will take a 7x8 mosaic of a sand
ripple. In the afternoon, MAHLI will take some images of Barby and Kibnas, and
then APXS will take measurements of both targets. At night, MAHLI will be back
in action for some night-time images of Barby and then APXS will do a longer
overnight measurement.</p>
<p>On sol 1185, after driving the rover will collect standard
post-drive imaging, plus an 8x1 Mastcam mosaic. On sol 1186, the rover will
take some Navcam images to make sure sand from the dunes isn’t piling up on the
rover deck or damaging the camera lenses. Originally we were hoping to do some
atmospheric measurements on sol 1186 as well, but they were removed from the
plan because it was getting too complicated. &nbsp;We still have plenty of atmospheric science
planned for the early morning science block on sol 1187 though, including two
Navcam movies, a ChemCam passive sky measurement, and Mastcam measurements of
atmospheric dust.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">by&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

<p>Today we are planning the last sol of the mobility test,
turning and backing out of the sand while taking multiple Hazcam images, then
pausing to take Navcam and Mastcam images of the wheel tracks.&nbsp; But first, Mastcam will take multispectral
images of a rock named “Narabeb” and a soil target dubbed “Kubib.”&nbsp; The right Mastcam will also acquire another
2x2 mosaic of Secomib, to look for changes in the trench wall, and image the
spots where the APXS was placed on the sand.&nbsp;
The biggest challenge for me as SOWG Chair today was to prioritize the
post-drive data, as the volume of data expected to be received in time for
planning tomorrow is smaller than usual.&nbsp;
We’re hoping that the rover will drive close enough to “<a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01181/opgs/edr/ncam/NRB_502337811EDR_F0511298NCAM00258M_.JPG" target="_blank">High Dune</a>”
to allow contact science on the dark dune sand, so we’ll need good images of
the arm workspace.&nbsp; But we’re also
planning to drive again this weekend, so we’ll also need images in the
direction of the drive.&nbsp; It looks like we
will get just enough data to enable a full weekend plan, assuming that all the orbiter
and ground assets work as we’ve come to expect.&nbsp;

<p>Later in the afternoon, the ChemCam RMI and right Mastcam
will acquire a small mosaic of an outcrop up on Mount Sharp, and both Mastcams
will image the ground in front of the rover.&nbsp;
Finally, the left Mastcam will acquire a mosaic of the ground and sand
to the right of the rover, and MARDI will take another twilight image.</p><p>by Ken Herkenhoff</p>

yesterday’s mobility test where we drove a little ways into a sand patch and
then backed out, leaving trenches where the wheels were. Yes, we’re disturbing
some of the very photogenic sand ripples that we have been seeing, but it’s for
a good cause: it teaches us more about how well we can drive in that sand, and
by using the wheels to make trenches like this, we can get a better idea of the
internal structure of the sand ripples. </p>
<p>In the Sol 1182 plan Mastcam has a 2x2 mosaic of a ripple
cut by the trench called “Sechomib”, a multispectral observation of the left
wall of the trench at a target called “Hoanib”, and a 6x3 mosaic of an outcrop
called “Aminius”. ChemCam has two observations, one on Hoanib, and the other on
the far wall of the trench, called “Awasib”. Mastcam will take documentation
images of both of these targets after ChemCam has finished.</p>
<p>Once the remote sensing is done, the rest of the plan is
focused on contact science on the sand, with MAHLI images of the undisturbed
sand, the walls of the wheel track, and the interior of the track. Then APXS
will make an overnight measurement of the track.</p>

<p>Due to problems at the Goldstone DSN complex, the bundle of
command sequences generated for Sol 1180 could not be sent to MSL.&nbsp; So the rover performed minimal activities on
Sol 1180, as expected in “runout” mode.&nbsp; The
good news is that the rover’s batteries are charged up, and the engineering
team determined that activities can be planned after the heater table update by
avoiding the types of heating that are affected by the update.&nbsp; So the Sol 1181 plan includes the first part
of the mobility test:&nbsp; drive a few meters
into the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01179/opgs/edr/ncam/NRB_502163360EDR_F0511126NCAM00257M_.JPG" target="_blank">dark sand</a> in front of the rover<a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01179/opgs/edr/ncam/NRB_502163360EDR_F0511126NCAM00257M_.JPG"></a>,
then back up enough to allow study of the rover tracks using the arm
instruments.&nbsp; During the drive, MARDI
will acquire many images of the surface behind the left front wheel, to
document the sand as it is disturbed by the wheel.&nbsp; After the drive and the standard post-drive
imaging are completed, ChemCam will observe its calibration targets, RMI and
Mastcam will image part of Mount Sharp in the distance, and Navcam will search
for clouds.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Today science and engineering teams cooked up a full 3-sol plan, to account for the second half of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.&nbsp; The team started with equal parts Mastcam and ChemCam to analyze the sand and bedrock, and to monitor the movement of sand across the rover deck and in nearby ripples.&nbsp; The meat of the plan consists of SAM preconditioning, drop off of the “Greenhorn” drill sample to SAM, and an EGA (evolved gas analysis).&nbsp; Essentially that means that we’ll heat the sample up in an oven and measure the major gases that are released.&nbsp; Since this is a very power intensive activity, we kept the sides to a minimum.&nbsp; On the third sol we planned a healthy dose of MAHLI wheel imaging to monitor wear and tear.&nbsp; We also added in a handful of post-drive imaging activities since the wheel imaging requires us to move slightly and we want to have updated information for targeting.&nbsp; And we squeezed in an additional Mastcam change detection experiment to monitor the ripples on the third sol.&nbsp; Sprinkled throughout the plan are our standard RAD and REMS and DAN measurements. &nbsp;Add in a dash of excitement about the opportunity to study active dunes on another planet, and it’s sure to be a great weekend on Mars.</p>

<p>Today we’re planning 3 sols to cover part of the long weekend (we’ll plan an additional 3 sols tomorrow).&nbsp; I was the Geology Science Theme Lead today, and it was a real challenge to fit everything into the plan while staying within our power constraints.&nbsp; On the first sol, Curiosity will acquire ChemCam and Mastcam on a small patch of sand to assess its composition and morphology.&nbsp; Then we’ll drive further to the southwest, and take some Navcam images to prepare for future targeting.&nbsp; We’ll also run the first of several change detection experiments, to try to monitor sand movement in a small sandsheet.&nbsp; The second sol includes a number of environmental monitoring activities to assess the composition and opacity of the atmosphere using ChemCam and Mastcam.&nbsp; On the morning of the third sol, we’ll use Navcam to monitor the atmosphere and search for dust devils.&nbsp; In the afternoon of Sol 1176, we’ll perform another part of the change detection experiment to look for ripple movement, and we’ll acquire another Mastcam mosaic of the dune to our west to look for variations in ripple morphology.&nbsp; We’ll also perform some ChemCam calibration activities, a Mastcam mosaic of the local bedrock, a clast survey, and a Navcam atmospheric observation.&nbsp; Throughout the plan, REMS will be taking a number of observations, which should be very helpful to assess wind speeds as we monitor these dunes.&nbsp; Adding further complexity to the plan, CheMin will dump the “Greenhorn” sample and analyze an empty cell in preparation for upcoming sampling.&nbsp; After such a busy plan over the holiday, Curiosity will require some time to rest and recharge (sound familiar?).&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe travels Curiosity!<span style="font-size: 0.92em;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The Bagnold Dunes are tantalizingly close, and this week is mostly focused on driving to the dunes.&nbsp; On Sol 1167 Curiosity drove 39 m, and the dunes are starting to look pretty big, as seen in the above&nbsp;<a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NRB_501099768EDR_F0510000NCAM00252M_&amp;s=1167" target="_blank">Navcam image</a>.&nbsp; For more on our plans when we get to the dunes, check out this recent <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2015-351&amp;rn=news.xml&amp;rst=4772" target="_blank">press release</a>.
</p>
<p>The plan today looks very similar to yesterday, with a pre-drive science block, a drive, and post-drive imaging.&nbsp; Science activities include Mastcam and ChemCam observations of the local bedrock at a target named “Etosha,” as well as Mastcam deck monitoring to look for fine sand that might accumulate as we approach the active dunes.&nbsp; After the drive we’ll acquire standard imaging to prepare for future targeting and terrain assessment.&nbsp; We’re also planning a SAM atmospheric observation to look for methane, exactly one Mars year after the previous high detections. &nbsp;Meanwhile, here on Earth, the ChemCam team is meeting at the USGS in Flagstaff, which means that Ken, Ryan and I will only be able to blog intermittently this week.&nbsp; But I’m looking forward to being back on GSTL duty next week… especially with the exciting dune campaign coming up!</p>

problem with the Deep Space Network that prevented the plans from being sent to
the rover. As someone on the team pointed out in response to the issue, this
just goes to show how many steps in the process have to go just right for us to
be able to operate a rover on Mars, and it’s pretty impressive that these sorts
of issues are as rare as they are.</p>
<p>Given its lack of instructions, Curiosity spent the weekend
in “runout” mode. Runout mode mostly consists of environmental monitoring.
Since the weekend plan was not uplinked, much of today’s plan contains repeats
of what we tried to do over the weekend.</p>
<p>In the sol 1166 plan, ChemCam has observations of the
targets “Zaris” and “Swakop”, and Mastcam has a 5x4 mosaic of “Swakop” and its
surroundings. Then we have a block of arm activities to allow MAHLI to take
some images of the targets “Swartkloofberg” and “Swakop”. This will be followed
by brushing the dust off of Swartkloofberg, taking some more MAHLI images, and
then placing APXS on Swartkloofberg to analyze it overnight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this week is the ChemCam team meeting here at
USGS in Flagstaff! Since much of the team will be busy with the meeting,
ChemCam activities this week will be kept to just two or three per day. The
meeting also means that Ken, Lauren, and I will be extra busy this week so we
won’t be blogging every day even though operations will be happening daily.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">By&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

<p>The rover drove over 38 meters on Sol 1162, as expected.&nbsp; We are transitioning out of restricted planning, so only 2 sols are being planned for this weekend.&nbsp; There were so many good ideas for activities this morning that the team had to decide which to remove from the plan to leave enough charge in the rover's batteries to enable nominal planning <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">on Monday</span></span>.&nbsp; Still, the plan is a very full one:&nbsp; On Sol 1164, ChemCam and Mastcam will observe one of the Bagnold Dunes that is a near-term goal for detailed investigation, plus other more nearby targets called "Swakop" and "Zaris."&nbsp; After another AEGIS checkout activity, the arm will be deployed to take a MAHLI image of the <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01097/mhli/1097MH0000950010401039C00_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">REMS UV sensor</a> and of a rock dubbed "Swartkloofberg."&nbsp; Then the DRT will brush the dust off Swartkloofberg and MAHLI will acquire mosaics of the brushed spot and of Swakop before the APXS is placed on the brushed spot for<br>
an overnight integration.<br>
<br>
On Sol 1165, the arm will be stowed and the rover will drive farther south, again orienting the vehicle for REMS wind measurements.&nbsp; After sunset, SAM will clean its scrubbers, an engineering activity that has been performed twice before.&nbsp; Finally, the rover will go to sleep and
recharge in preparation for the next sol's activities.<br>

Today is a holiday for some of us, but not the MSL tactical operations<br>
team!&nbsp; The 55-meter drive planned for Sol 1160 completed as planned,<br>
and another 41-meter drive is planned for Sol 1162.&nbsp; Before the next<br>
drive, Mastcam and ChemCam will observe a small, sandy drift named<br>
"Arris" and a bedrock target dubbed "Tsumeb."&nbsp; Mastcam will also<br>
acquire two mosaics, one of nearby outcrops and one of more distant<br>
rocks.&nbsp; The drive should place the rover between two of the Bagnold<br>
Dunes, so the vehicle will turn to a heading that will maximize the<br>
chances of acquiring good REMS measurements of wind speed and<br>
direction.&nbsp; This observation is part of the dune study campaign that<br>
has been developed over the past year, with an overall goal of better<br>
understanding how winds on Mars form and modify dunes.&nbsp; Observations<br>
of the dunes from orbit show that they are active, so many members of<br>
the MSL science team are looking forward to detailed measurements of<br>

plan starts off with an activity to test out AEGIS, a software tool that will
help with choosing targets for ChemCam and Mastcam. The AEGIS activity will
take ChemCam images of two targets: “Ashley Lakes” and “Amsden”. That is
followed by a ChemCam observation of the target “Augusta”. Mastcam will take supporting
images of Ashley Lakes and Amsden, plus an image of “Dodd Ranch” and two
mosaics: a 3x2 and a 9x2.</p>
<p>Once the remote sensing is done, the arm will get a workout.
MAHLI and Mastcam have some images of the sky to help with calibration, and
then MAHLI will take some images of its own calibration target and the APXS
calibration target. After that, MAHLI will take some images of the wheels, and
then APXS will measure its calibration target. Once that is finished, we will
brush the dust off of the target Augusta, take some Mastcam and MAHLI images of
it, and then place APXS on it to make some measurements on and off the brushed
spot.</p>
<p>On Sol 1158 the rover will drive to a location that looks to
be a nice viewpoint, and that will be followed by standard post-drive images,
including a 27x2 360 degree panorama with Mastcam. On Sol 1159, Mastcam has a
tau observation to measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere, and Navcam has
a couple of movies to watch for clouds and dust devils. Later in the day,
Mastcam will do another tau, and ChemCam will make a measurement of its
titanium calibration target.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">By&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

few Navcam images down to show us possible science targets, which limited our
choices for ChemCam observations. We are all looking forward to Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter (MRO) waking up from the intentional “safe mode” status that it has
been in this week! Still, even with limited data we were able to put together a
good plan. </p>
<p>On Sol 1155, ChemCam will observe the targets “Thermopolis”
and “Pinckney” to get measurements of the typical bedrock and typical soil or
sand in the area, plus a long-distance image of one of the sand dunes that we
are approaching. ChemCam will also do a focus test observation that was
originally planned for last weekend, but which did not get uplinked because of
a problem with the Deep Space Network. Mastcam will take documentation images
of the two ChemCam targets and the distant sand dune, plus a 13x3 mosaic of a
nearby outcrop. After that, the rover will drive and take standard post-drive
images.</p>
<p>On Sol 1156, we have a pretty light day. There are no
geology observations, but several environmental and atmospheric measurements,
including a couple Mastcam taus to measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere, some DAN observations, and a Navcam movie to
look for clouds. MARDI also has a post-drive image of the ground under the
rover. </p>
<p>I’ve been “Keeper of the Plan” for the Geology and
Mineralogy group today and Monday, but I’ll be switching over to ChemCam uplink
for Friday. The weekend plan looks like it will be focused on contact science,
but we should be able to fit some ChemCam in there too!</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">By&nbsp;<a style="color: #4ea1dc;" href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

Before we drive, ChemCam will analyze the targets “Tampico”, “LaValle”, and “Muddy” to determine if their apparent variations in brightness in the Navcam images correspond to a variation in chemistry. Mastcam will take documentation images of the ChemCam targets, plus a 13x3 mosaic of the resistant outcrop “East Glacier” and its surroundings.&nbsp;</p><p>After the drive, which will take us past and around “East Glacier” and the dark material behind it, we will do our standard post-drive imaging. This week is a bit tricky because Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is in (intentional) Safe Mode for most of the week, meaning Curiosity can’t send as much data back to Earth. So, it’s possible that the post-drive imaging that we usually use to target ChemCam won’t come down in time to choose targets on Wednesday. If that happens, we’ll have to make do with the Hazcam images.</p><p>On Sol 1154, we are planning a ChemCam passive sky observation, plus Navcam movies to watch for clouds and dust devils.

After that, we drove for 32 meters, followed by standard post-drive imaging. On Sol 1149, ChemCam did a bunch of calibration observations and Navcam and Mastcam did some standard atmospheric observations.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.92em; line-height: 22.08px;">The drive on Sol 1148 put us in range of some interesting rocks, and the Sol 1150-1152 plan is focusing on analyzing our new surroundings. On Sol 1150, Mastcam has an 8x4 mosaic of some interesting layered rocks, followed by ChemCam and Mastcam observations of the targets “Dunkirk” and “Duperow”.

This is followed by ChemCam observations of Ennis and Exshaw and the accompanying Mastcam documentation images. In the afternoon on Sol 1151, there will be a short drive to the southeast which should provide data to allow a longer drive in the next plan.

The focus for Sol 1146 is to get some good color stereo images of the whole area, including “Big Sky,” “Greenhorn,” and “Meeteetse”. Mastcam will take a 16x3 mosaic of the Meeteetse area, plus a 12x1 right-eye mosaic of some nearby resistant ridges. It will also measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere by looking at the sun, and take a documentation image of the target “Belle Fourche” after ChemCam analyzes it. ChemCam also has a “passive sky” observation, where we use the ChemCam spectrometers to stare at the sky and measure the abundance of gases in the atmosphere.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><span style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">On Sol 1147, the main activity is to deliver some of the material sampled at the “Greenhorn” drill hole to the SAM instrument, and then run a SAM evolved gas analysis and tunable laser spectrometer (EGA/TLS) experiment on the sample.

<p>Unfortunately the Sol 1135 bundles were not uplinked due to a DSN issue, so the activities that we planned yesterday never made it onboard.&nbsp; However, that meant that Curiosity spent the day resting and recharging in time for a lot of great science this weekend.</p>
<p>Today’s 3-sol plan will recover most of the activities that were planned for Sol 1135, in addition to the main activity of a full drill hole on the “Greenhorn” target.&nbsp; On the first sol, Curiosity will acquire several ChemCam and Mastcam observations on the targets “Nisku,” “Skull Creek,” “Hawk Creek,” and “Opeche,” to investigate the variability in silica associated with these fracture zones.&nbsp; We’ll also take several Mastcam images to look for changes in fine-grained deposits to evaluate local winds.&nbsp; Overnight, we’ll use MAHLI to image the CheMin inlet in preparation for drilling activities.&nbsp; On the second sol, we’ll go for the full drill hole on “Greenhorn,” followed by MAHLI imaging of the drill hole.&nbsp; The third sol consists of several environmental monitoring activities to assess the composition and opacity of the atmosphere.&nbsp; We’ll also squeeze in some Mastcam observations of the “Big Sky” dump pile and drill tailings using all of the camera filters.&nbsp; The only activity that we won’t have time for is the SAM atmospheric methane detection, but we’re hoping to get that sometime next week.&nbsp; I’ll be on duty again on Monday, so I’m looking forward to seeing the
results from the latest drill hole!</p>

</p><p>Columbus Day is a federal holiday, but I'm scheduled as SOWG Chair
tomorrow so I'm following Sol 1132 tactical planning and discussions of
our goals for Sol 1133.&nbsp; The SAM analysis of the Big Sky drill sample
went well and there is no need for another analysis, so the rest of the
sample will be dumped out of CHIMRA on Sol 1132.&nbsp; MAHLI will take
pictures of the dump target before and after the sample is dumped, then
APXS will be placed on the dump pile for an overnight integration.&nbsp; Once
CHIMRA is cleaned out, we'll be ready to acquire another drill sample;

I got up before dawn again today, and was treated to a beautiful view of the crescent Moon, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter in the eastern sky.&nbsp; I hadn't seen Mars since it emerged from behind the Sun following solar conjunction last June (it was cloudy yesterday morning), and its dimness reminded me of how far away Mars is right now:&nbsp; 351 million kilometers or 218 million miles.&nbsp; It takes 20 minutes for commands sent from Earth to get to MSL, at the speed of light, and another 20 minutes for data to be sent back from Mars to Earth.&nbsp; We've gotten used to communicating with the rover over such great distances, but it's amazing that the link has been so reliable.<br>
<br>
The Sol 1127 data received this morning show that the MAHLI wheel imaging and the 7-meter drive completed successfully, and initial analysis of the <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01127/mhli/1127MH0002610010401788E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">wheel images</a> show no significant changes in wheel wear.&nbsp; The drive placed the rover within reach of the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01127/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_497555280EDR_F0500676NCAM00353M_.JPG" target="_blank">fracture</a> of interest, and as predicted we received just enough data to allow us to select remote sensing targets.&nbsp; So the Sol 1128 plan begins with ChemCam and Mastcam observations of "Benchmark," "Greenhorn," and "Pilgrim" to see if they would be good targets for more detailed investigation.&nbsp; Later in the day, Navcam will acquire a full panorama and search for dust devils and clouds.&nbsp; Then MAHLI will be used to take images of Greenhorn and Pilgrim from 35 centimeters away, to help the Rover Planners determine whether they can be drilled.<br>

Planning is no longer restricted, but to ensure that Sol 1127 commands
are ready to be sent to the rover on time, we had to start planning 1.5 hours earlier than usual this morning.&nbsp; The <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01126/mhli/1126MH0002650000401780R00_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">Sol 1126 images</a> show
that the APXS was well centered over the pre-sieve dump pile, so we are ready to move on.&nbsp; It's time for a ful<span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">l set of</span></span>
MAHLI wheel images, which dominate the Sol 1127 plan.&nbsp; After the wheel
imaging, there's just enough time for a short drive to another <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01120/mcam/1120MR0049930070601435E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">potential
drill target</a> and post-drive imaging.&nbsp; The volume of data expected to be received in
time for planning tomorrow is smaller than usual, so we had to carefully
consider data priorities.&nbsp; With luck, we'll receive enough of the
post-drive images to select targets for remote sensing tomorrow
morning.&nbsp; Planning will start at 6:30 PDT again tomorrow, so many of us
will be getting up before dawn, but it's well worth it to keep the rover
going!<br>

measurements, better centered on the dump pile.&nbsp; Before the arm
activities, ChemCam will acquire passive spectra of part of Mt. Sharp, a
5x1 LIBS raster on "Canadian Creek," and an RMI image of the ChemCam
calibration target. Then MAHLI will be used to take another
self-portrait of the rover, and the APXS will be placed on the dump pile

The weekend plan includes lots of arm activities and science.&nbsp; First,
on Sol 1123, ChemCam and Mastcam will observe the<a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1860" target="_blank"> drill hole</a> and
tailings, plus targets named "Frontier," "Floweree," "Bozeman," and "Billings."&nbsp;
Then the portion of the sample that has not been sieved will be dumped
on the ground and examined by Mastcam.&nbsp; After dusk, MAHLI will use its
LEDs to look inside of the drill hole and image the drill tailings and
CheMin inlet, then APXS will be placed over the tailings for an
overnight measurement.&nbsp; Late in the afternoon of Sol 1124, MAHLI will
image the pre-sieve dump pile and APXS will be placed over it for another
overnight integration.</p><p>A SAM atmospheric methane measurement was added early on Sol 1125 because Mars recently went through the path of comet Damocles.&nbsp; Dust ejected from comets is often carbon-rich, and therefore is a <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2015/pdf/5286.pdf" target="_blank">possible source of the elevated methane concentration</a> that has occasionally been observed by SAM.&nbsp; After all those activities, the rover will sleep through most of Sol 1125 to recharge its batteries in preparation for Sol 1126.<br>

on sol 1120, Navcam and Mastcam both have some atmospheric observations. And of
course, in the background DAN, RAD, and REMS will be doing their routine
monitoring as always.</p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;">By&nbsp;<a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="line-height: 22.08px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.72px; line-height: 22.08px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.08px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p></div>

how we test if the rock is safe to drill. MAHLI will take documentation images

will analyze the targets “Beartooth Pass” and “Bear Trap Canyon”, and Mastcam will
take some pictures of two drifted sand targets (“Bozeman” and “Billings” - we’re
on a Montana naming theme right now), as well as a 2x1 mosaic of an interesting
altered vein, and a 7x1 mosaic of a nearby outcrop. MAHLI will also take some
more images of the mini-start hole.</p>

meters because we were driving over rough terrain and part of the rover’s
suspension exceeded the allowed amount of tilt (this is not a physical limit,
just a threshold in the software that tells the rover to stop and check with
Earth to be safe). The rover is fine and we plan to drive again in the Sol 1112
plan. Meanwhile we are trying to decide where in the area we want to drill to
maximize the science return. There are a lot of options because we’re
surrounded by interesting geology!</p>
<p>Before we drive, we have some ChemCam observations of
targets “Dakota”, “Conrad”, and “Firemoon”, plus two Mastcam mosaics of a
potential drill target. I was on duty as ChemCam sPUL today, so two of the
three targets are ones that I chose, which is always fun. I didn’t choose the
names (someone else was quicker with the naming list than I was), but I
especially like the name “Firemoon”. </p>

The 16.6-meter drive planned for Sol 1107 completed as planned, placing the rover in front of the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01107/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_495768147EDR_F0500250NCAM00278M_.JPG" target="_blank">bright outcrop</a> of interest.&nbsp; As expected, only a few post-drive images were received in time for Sol 1108 planning, which made it more difficult than usual to pick targets for remote sensing observations and driving.&nbsp; However, we found some bright blocks that the Rover Planners confirmed would be good targets for contact science, and plan is to approach and study them this weekend.&nbsp; But first ChemCam and Mastcam will observe nearby rock and soil targets named "Sphinx," "Houle," and "Utopia."&nbsp; After the short drive, we decided not to acquire the usual MAHLI stowed image and MARDI twilight image, as the view from MAHLI will not be<br>
very different than the previous image, and we can't acquire the MARDI image when we would like because there will be a Mars Odyssey communications session at that time.&nbsp; We can acquire these images on Sol 1109 anyway.&nbsp; So it was an easy day for me as MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead today, and I helped pick ChemCam/Mastcam targets.<br>

<p>Over the weekend,
Curiosity had a successful ~ 21 m drive, and we’re currently parked in front of a beautiful outcrop of the Murray formation (shown in the bottom half of the above Navcam image, overlain by Stimson).&nbsp; We’ve mostly been driving through the Stimson unit for the past 280 m, so this is a great opportunity to do contact science on the Murray formation to look for any changes in composition or grain size.</p>
<p>I was the Geology Theme Lead today, and our plan consists of 1.5 hours of targeted remote science, followed by contact science.&nbsp; We planned several ChemCam and Mastcam observations on the targets “Winnipeg,” “Alma,” and “Blackjack.”&nbsp; “Winnipeg” is a target in the Murray formation that we’ll also assess with MAHLI and APXS.&nbsp; “Alma” is aimed at characterizing the composition across the Murray-Stimson contact, and “Blackjack” is a resistant ledge within the Murray formation.&nbsp; We’ll also acquire a couple of Mastcam mosaics to document the Murray-Stimson contact and characterize the local structure and stratification, and a Mastcam tau to assess atmospheric opacity.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the afternoon we’ll acquire several MAHLI images of the “Sacajawea” target to investigate a resistant ledge.&nbsp; Then we’ll use the DRT to brush off the dust on “Winnipeg” and take some really close MAHLI images to look for grain size variations.&nbsp; Overnight, we’ll use APXS to investigate the composition of the “Winnipeg” target.</p>

</p><p>The Sol 1101 activities that we planned yesterday did not complete due<br>
to an arm error while it was being stowed.&nbsp; Apparently the shoulder<br>
azimuth motor was too cold, so the rover software halted the stow,<br>
which precluded the drive that was to follow.&nbsp; The rover is therefore<br>
in the same position that it was yesterday.<br>
<br>
I'm not scheduled in any operational role today, but I called in to<br>
help plan MAHLI imaging of the ChemCam optical window, to monitor dust<br>
accumulation.&nbsp; The operations team had to scramble to recover from the arm<br>
error and plan science observations, but was able to put together an<br>
excellent weekend plan.&nbsp; On Sol 1102, MAHLI will take the standard<br>
images of the rover wheels, then acquire a full suite of images of a<br>
rock dubbed "Badlands."&nbsp; APXS will then be placed on the rock for an<br>
overnight integration.&nbsp; Arm work will continue on Sol 1103, with MAHLI<br>
images of the ChemCam window.&nbsp; Then ChemCam and Mastcam will observe<br>
targets named "Madison" and "Jefferson."&nbsp; On Sol 1104, the RMI and<br>
Mastcam will take images of a <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01100/mcam/1100ML0048710060500490E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">bright ridge</a> on the flank of Mt. Sharp,<br>
then ChemCam and Mastcam will observe "Lincoln."&nbsp; Mastcam will also<br>
acquire another mosaic of the wall of Bridger Basin, then the rover<br>
will drive to the bright Murray outcrop "Saddle" as planned yesterday.<br>
Fortunately, the Sol 1104 orbiter overflight geometry is better than<br>
it was yesterday, so we expect to receive all the data needed for<br>
planning <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">on Monday</span></span>.&nbsp; Finally, early on Sol 1105, Mastcam and Navcam<br>
will observe the sun and sky soon after the Mars Odyssey orbiter flies<br>
over, so that orbiter observations can be compared with nearly<br>
simultaneous observations from the surface. Overall, not a bad plan,<br>
considering that the operations team had to quickly respond to the arm<br>
error!<br>

<p>The 34-meter drive
planned for Sol 1100 placed the rover at the edge of the small plateau,
as intended, with a good view of a bright <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01100/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_495148672EDR_F0492902NCAM00270M_.JPG" target="_blank">Murray Formation outcrop</a>.&nbsp;
The center of the Murray outcrop is the target of the drive planned for
Sol 1101, which will hopefully put the vehicle in position for contact
science over the weekend.&nbsp; Before the drive, ChemCam RMI and Mastcam
observations of targets named "Brady" and "Bradley"
are planned, both of which are on the far <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01100/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_495148745EDR_F0492902NCAM00270M_.JPG" target="_blank">wall of Bridger Basin</a>.&nbsp;
Mastcam will also observe a shallow trough in the soil next to the
rover ("Blackleaf Creek") and acquire a mosaic of the Murray exposure,
which has been named "Saddle."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Although MRO is now
relaying data as expected, it will pass low in the sky over MSL after
the Sol 1101 drive, so we aren't expecting to receive as much data as usual.&nbsp; The
biggest challenge for me as SOWG Chair today was
therefore planning and prioritizing the data we need for planning tomorrow.&nbsp; We're hoping that we get at least as much data as expected.</p>

<p>The rover drove 34.5 meters on Sol 1099, as planned, to a good location for the imaging of the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01099/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_495061043EDR_F0492626NCAM00268M_.JPG" target="_blank">northwest wall of Bridger Basin</a>.&nbsp;
The Mastcam team verified that the pointing of the mosaic of that wall,
planned to occur early on Sol 1100, is excellent.&nbsp; So the Sol 1100 plan
includes another drive, to the southwest edge of the small plateau the
rover is on.&nbsp; Before the drive, ChemCam and
Mastcam will observe nearby layered rocks dubbed "Swan" and "Sunburst,"
and Right Mastcam mosaics will be taken of targets named "Studhorse,"
"Sweetgrass Arch" and "Silver Hill."&nbsp; After the drive, in addition to
the standard post-driving activities, we're
planning a Right Mastcam mosaic of "Beartooth Butte" and a SAM

Fitting all of the desired observations into the plan was challenging,
otherwise I've had an easy day as SOWG Chair.&nbsp;

<p>MSL did well over the
long weekend, except that the Sol 1098 drive was halted after 13 meters
of the planned 25 meters because the rover could not confirm that the
path ahead was safe.&nbsp; So the plan for the Sol
1099 drive is essentially to complete the rest of the
previously planned drive.&nbsp; The only significant problem I've had to
grapple with today as SOWG Chair is that the last 5 relays of data
through MRO have returned significantly less data than expected; if
this problem continues, we will barely receive enough data to plan
another drive on Sol 1100.&nbsp; Fortunately, the MRO team understands the
problem and knows how to correct it, and there is a good chance that we
will receive all the data we need in time for planning
tomorrow
morning.&nbsp; This situation reminds me of how much we depend on the Mars
orbiters and the teams that operate them, and to thank them for their
continued support of the MSL mission.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Before the Sol 1099
drive, we have time to acquire ChemCam and Mastcam observations of
"Mission Creek" and "Chamberlain," plus MastCam mosaics of "<a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01098/opgs/edr/ncam/NRB_494970866EDR_F0492374NCAM00266M_.JPG" target="_blank">Bridger
Basin</a>,"
"Hackley Point," and "Police Creek."&nbsp; The rover will wake up early on
the morning of Sol 1100 to acquire a big stereo mosaic of the far wall
of Bridger Basin, because the illumination will be better early in the
morning.&nbsp; Mastcam will also take a 360-degree
panorama with the left camera.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Today’s plan
consists of ChemCam and Mastcam observations on the targets “Interlake,” “Ledger,” and “Mackay Dome.”&nbsp; Then we’ll image the “Ledger” target using all of the Mastcam camera filters, and take another Mastcam clast survey image to look for any changes in the time that we’ve been here.&nbsp; We’ll also use Mastcam to look at the sun to measure the atmospheric opacity.&nbsp; Then we’ll take a short drive and acquire post-drive imaging to help with targeting in tomorrow’s plan.&nbsp; It’s exciting to be driving again, and I’m sure we’ll encounter some beautiful views as we continue to drive through this interesting terrain.</p>

<p>Planning is no longer restricted, but we had to start at 6:00 PDT
this morning to give the operations team enough time to uplink commands by the time the rover expects them.&nbsp;
Driving to work before sunrise reminded me of the sometimes odd times we
had to wake up during the first 90 sols of the mission, when the entire
operations team was on "Mars time."
<br>
<br>
The team is very interested in the outcrop in front of the rover, so I
had a very busy day as MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead today, even though we are
planning just one sol.&nbsp; We planned in advance for MAHLI nighttime
imaging of CheMin's inlet and MAHLI's calibration
target (using white and UV LEDs), so those activities were ready to go
this morning.&nbsp; But we had to prioritize and plan the details of
observations of other contact science targets.&nbsp; Because the Sol 1089
MAHLI images and APXS placement were not perfectly centered
on the <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01089/mhli/1089MH0001930000400840R00_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">Buckskin dump pile</a>,
our top priority is to repeat those
observations with updated positioning.&nbsp; We planned MAHLI images of a
target dubbed "Devon," which will also be measured by APXS.&nbsp; Many of the
targets of interest are difficult to reach with the arm, so the rover
planners requested relatively low-resolution
MAHLI images of them to support planning of more contact science on Sol
1092.&nbsp; These targets were named "Pentagon," "Lebo," "Ivanhoe," and
"Ledger," with Ledger being imaged in stereo by Mastcam because it is a
candidate for brushing with the DRT.&nbsp; Finally,
the APXS will be placed on the dump pile for overnight integration.</p>
<p>We had to put more
thought than usual into prioritizing various data for downlink, as we
expect only 38 Mbits of data before Sol 1092 planning begins tomorrow morning.&nbsp; This situation forced us to compress some of the
MAHLI images more than usual, and to create new command sequences.&nbsp; But if all goes well, we will receive enough data tomorrow morning to plan contact science on multiple targets.</p><p>

<p>The complex, nearly
39-meter Sol 1085 drive completed successfully, leaving the rover in
another target-rich area.&nbsp; Again, I helped pick targets for ChemCam
observations--our favorites were on the brighter parts
of the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01085/opgs/edr/ncam/NRB_493826420EDR_F0491798NCAM00254M_.JPG" target="_blank">outcrop just south of the rover</a>.&nbsp;
The targets for ChemCam and Mastcam observations were named
"Fitzpatrick," "Keith," and "Fred and George Creek."&nbsp; Mastcam will also
acquire 2 mosaics before the rover drives away on Sol 1087.&nbsp; Planning is
still restricted, so we also planned Sol 1088, which
starts with early-morning Mastcam and Navcam images of the sun and
sky.&nbsp; Similar observations are planned around noon
that sol, to measure daily variations in atmospheric dust and clouds.&nbsp;
Finally, CheMin's inlet funnel will be vibrated in an attempt to remove
a <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01064/mhli/1064MH0003120020400582C00_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">particle</a> from the screen over the funnel.&nbsp;

<p>MSL had a good weekend, and returned lots of data including nice MAHLI images of <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01082/mhli/1082MH0001530000400790R00_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">Ravalli</a>.&nbsp;
The nearly 22-meter Sol 1083 drive completed as planned, and placed the
rover near some nice rock outcrops.&nbsp; I helped the planning team select
targets for ChemCam observations; we settled on two that were named
"Tinder Box" and "Gordon."&nbsp; Mastcam will acquire
mosaics of these targets as well as "Centennial Range" and "Willow
Ridge."&nbsp; There isn't time/power for much more science, as another drive
is planned for Sol 1085 and an overnight SAM atmospheric observation.&nbsp;
ChemCam, Mastcam and Navcam will make more atmospheric
observations late in the morning of Sol 1086, along with the usual REMS
background measurements.&nbsp; The <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01083/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_493646326EDR_F0491420NCAM00251M_.JPG" target="_blank">path ahead</a>

<p>I'm having another
very busy day as SOWG Chair, as we are planning lots of activities to
keep the rover busy this weekend.&nbsp; The vehicle is on a local high spot
that gives us a spectacular <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01080/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_493379909EDR_F0491216NCAM05113M_.JPG" target="_blank">view of the terrain

so we selected only one (called "Ravalli") to investigate using MAHLI
and APXS.&nbsp; We had time for another contact science target, but decided
that it would not be worthwhile to study the smaller rocks that are
within arm's reach.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>On Sol 1082, ChemCam
and Mastcam will observe Ravalli and a brighter rock dubbed "Sawtooth"
before Mastcam acquires a 23x6 mosaic of the nice outcrops ahead.&nbsp;
Mastcam and Navcam will look up at the sky at about
the same time that the Mars Odyssey orbiter will be passing over, to
compare results of observations from above and the surface.&nbsp; Then the
arm will be deployed for contact science and the APXS placed on Ravalli
for overnight integration.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>ChemCam and Mastcam will observe a couple more
bright blocks on Sol 1083, named "Stonewall" and "Wolsey," before the
rover drives toward the south.&nbsp; We'll then acquire the usual post-drive
images and DAN active data.&nbsp; On the last sol (1084),
ChemCam will take some calibration data and SAM will clean its scrubber
in preparation for future measurement.&nbsp;

putting us in a good position for the sol 1074 plan. It’s a pretty simple plan
today, with time for a single ChemCam observation of a target called “Crazy
Mountain”. I got to pick the name for this target (one of my favorite parts of
being involved in operations), and it seemed fitting since the target is on a
big layered block that is tilted at a crazy angle. Mastcam will take a 3x3
mosaic of this rock, plus a right-eye image of the target “Blodget” and a 20x1
mosaic of the outcrops and mesas to the east, named “Sa-ol-Sooth”. After that,
we will drive some more, and do some post-drive imaging so that we can do some
targeted observations in the weekend plan.</p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By&nbsp;<a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p></div>

pictures to document the geology in our new location. We are planning a 31x1
mosaic of the outcrop in Marias Pass, plus a 13x3 mosaic of “Mt. Shields” (not
to be confused with Mt. Sharp!) and a 10x3 stereo mosaic of “Gunton”. Navcam
also has 8 frames of atmospheric observations of the horizon to the north. Once
we are done taking pictures, the plan is to drive for another ~40 meters. </p>
<p>After the drive, we will do our normal post-drive imaging so
that we can plan activities for tomorrow, plus an “active” measurement with DAN
(meaning that the instrument will produce neutrons to help detect hydrogen in
the subsurface, rather than relying on natural background neutrons). The plan
also includes some early morning Navcam and Mastcam atmospheric observations on
sol 1074.</p>

<p>To celebrate starting her 4<sup>th</sup> year on Mars, Curiosity is driving away from the Lion outcrop, and back toward the Missoula outcrop.&nbsp; I feel like Curiosity has really grown up in these past couple of years, and she’s acting like a true field geologist – quickly interpreting key science data, and revisiting sites that will improve our understanding of the geologic history here.&nbsp; In today’s plan, Curiosity will make a couple of final observations at Lion before driving away.&nbsp; In the morning we’ll acquire ChemCam and Mastcam on the target “Moiese” to look for chemical variations across the outcrop.&nbsp; Just before driving away, we’ll take one last Mastcam image of the <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=1064MR0046800010104831E01_DXXX&amp;s=1064" target="_blank">dump pile</a>, using all of the camera filters.&nbsp; Then we’ll drive back towards Missoula, and take some Navcam images to prepare for ChemCam targeting in tomorrow’s plan.

<p>The activities planned for last weekend completed successfully, including sample dropoff to <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/01061/mcam/1061ML0046700000306184E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">CheMin</a> and analysis of the minerals present.&nbsp; So the Sol 1064 plan includes
dumping the portion of the drill sample that has not been sieved and
Mastcam, ChemCam, MAHLI, and APXS observations of the dump pile.&nbsp;
ChemCam and Mastcam will also observe nearby targets
"Martz" and "Mountain Home."&nbsp; MAHLI will image the drill hole, tailings
and CheMin inlet at night using its LEDs for illumination.&nbsp; Such
nighttime observations require extra power for heating, so I had to pay
extra attention to the power modeling as SOWG Chair
today.&nbsp; Fortunately, we didn't have to delete any observations to
maintain plenty of charge in the batteries, and I'm happy with the plan
we will be sending to the rover this evening.&nbsp;

<p>Today’s plan is focused on the drilling activity, and a lot of imaging to document the hole. &nbsp;First we’ll acquire MAHLI images of the intended drill site, then we’ll drill, and then we’ll acquire more MAHLI images after drilling.&nbsp; The plan also includes Navcam imaging of the workspace, and Mastcam imaging of the target and drill bit.&nbsp; In addition to drilling, we’re getting CheMin ready to receive sample in an upcoming plan.&nbsp; Fingers crossed!</p><p><span style="font-size: 13.5424003601074px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/lauren-edgar">Lauren Edgar</a></span></p>

determine whether it is safe to go ahead with the full hole.</p>
<p>In addition to that test, we are planning a detailed study
of the target “Ch-paa-qn” which means “shining peak” in the native Salish
language of northern Montana. This target is an isolated bright patch on the
nearby outcrop, and we want to figure out if it is calcium sulfate like the
white veins we see nearby, or if it is something else. The plan includes
ChemCam active and passive observations of Ch-paa-qn, along with Mastcam
multispectral images. </p>
<p>After that, we have an atmospheric observation, and then
some MAHLI and APXS measurements of the mini-start hole and the full drill
target.</p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By&nbsp;<a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p></div>

where we want to be to attempt drilling at “Buckskin” in the “Lion” area. I was
on duty as ChemCam sPUL (science payload uplink lead) today, and it was a fun day to be on duty. Sometimes it
can be stressful trying to make sure that all the settings are correct and that
the instrument will be safe, but today everything was easy and I got to spend
more time on the fun stuff like choosing targets and their names!</p>
<p>The sol 1057 plan starts off with a Mastcam observation of
some disturbed soil at the target “Calamity” followed by ChemCam observations
of “Blind Gulch”, “Sorrel Springs”, and “Buffalo Basin”. Mastcam also has a 4x5
stereo observation of the Lion area and some “tau” observations of the amount
of dust in the atmosphere. Once all that is done, we will brush a spot on “Buckskin”,
observe it with MAHLI, and then place APXS on it for an overnight measurement
of its composition.</p>
<p>After a busy sol 1057, sol 1058 is pretty calm: it is mostly
dedicated to weather monitoring with REMS, plus MARDI will take an image of the
ground underneath us.</p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By&nbsp;<a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

just over 20 meters, the rover stopped 4.4 meters short of the Sol 1049
drive goal because the vehicle pitch exceeded the 15-degree limit set by
the rover drivers.&nbsp; So another 6.4-meter drive toward the bright
outcrop of interest, dubbed "Lion,"
was planned for Sol 1051.&nbsp; That&nbsp; drive completed successfully,
providing a good <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01051/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_490799880EDR_F0482470NCAM00284M_.JPG" target="_blank">view of the outcrop</a>.&nbsp;
ChemCam and Mastcam observed the sand ripple "Agency" and bedrock target "<a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=CR0_490791692PRC_F0482422CCAM03051L1&amp;s=1051" target="_blank">Mullan</a>"
before the Sol 1051 drive.&nbsp; Now that the Lion outcrop is within LIBS
range, ChemCam and Mastcam observations of it are planned for Sol 1053,
specifically targets named "Sorrel Springs" and "Buckskin."&nbsp; A nearby
rock called "Hewolf" will also be observed before
the rover drives closer to the Lion outcrop.&nbsp; Hopefully the rover will
be in position for contact science on the outcrop this weekend.&nbsp; The Sol
1054 plan is much less complex, with a Navcam search for clouds above
the rover and ChemCam calibration activities.&nbsp;
The vehicle should be recharged and ready for a busy weekend plan!

and the rover is a little over 1 meter from its previous location.&nbsp; So
the outcrop to the right of the vehicle is still close enough for
ChemCam LIBS measurements, and I helped select new targets again today.&nbsp;
The Sol 1048 plan includes ChemCam and Mastcam
observations of "Pinto," "Palomino," and "Burnt Point" plus a Navcam
search for clouds toward the north.&nbsp; Then the arm will be deployed for
drill testing and CHIMRA maintenance activities in preparation for the
next drill activity.&nbsp; We are interested in sampling
the bright rocks east of the rover, but the Elk and Lamoose targets are
not suitable for drilling, so on Sol 1049 we plan to drive toward a
nearby <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00990/mcam/0990ML0043750030404478E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">bright outcrop</a> of what looks like the same material.&nbsp; We're hoping that we will be
able to sample that material with the drill.&nbsp; Early on the morning of
Sol 1050, Mastcam, Navcam, and ChemCam will observe the Sun and sky to
measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere, search
for clouds, and look for changes in atmospheric chemistry.&nbsp; Another

acquired before the wheel imaging on Sol 1046.&nbsp; After the wheel
imaging is complete, the usual post-drive images will be acquired, along
with additional Navcam stereo images of the outcrop
and a Mastcam observation of the Sun.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On Sol 1047, Mastcam
will acquire a mosaic of the outcrop to the right of the rover, and
ChemCam will make some calibration measurements.&nbsp; The Left Navcam will

instead of the intended ~25 meters) because the software that the rover uses to
monitor its drive progress was being extra cautious. The rover is fine, and in
the sol 1044 plan we will keep driving.</span></p>
<p>Before the drive, ChemCam has observations of targets of
varying textures named “Edith”, “Sheffer”, and “Finley”. Mastcam will take some
documentation images of the same targets, along with a stereo mosaic of some
interesting layered rocks and a complementary 4x3 mosaic of the nearby “Apikuni

So the weekend plan is a full one, including both contact science and a

passively (no laser) acquire spectra of the sky and a rock dubbed
"Monarch" before firing its laser at "Frog" and "Mosquito."&nbsp; Mastcam
will then take pictures of these rock targets as well as "Elk" and
"Lamoose."&nbsp; Later that afternoon, the arm will be deployed to take MAHLI
images of Lamoose, Mosquito, and the REMS UV sensor, then place the
APXS on Lamoose for an overnight integration.&nbsp; The drive, with DAN
measurements along the way, is planned for Sol 1042.&nbsp; In addition to the
usual post-drive imaging, Mastcam will again look for <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1842" target="_blank">spots on the
"back" side of the Sun</a>.&nbsp;
Overnight, SAM will complete a calibration activity.&nbsp; On Sol 1043,
ChemCam will take some calibration data, Navcam will search for clouds
near the northern horizon, and Mastcam will take another pair of Sun
images.&nbsp; Finally, late that night, CheMin will perform its own

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'm MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead today, and was ready
this morning to plan lots of MAHLI imaging of the bright rocks on the
slope the rover first climbed on Sol 991.&nbsp; But the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01038/opgs/edr/fcam/FLB_489634093EDR_F0481964FHAZ00323M_.JPG" target="_blank">data</a> received after
the 5.5-meter drive on Sol 1037 showed that the
left front wheel is perched right at the top of a small scarp at the top
of the slope.&nbsp;
After examining all the data, the rover planners determined that the
rover position is not safe for arm activities, as arm motion could cause
the front wheels to slip down the slope, putting the arm and its
instruments at risk.&nbsp; So all of the contact science
activities were removed from the plan, and remote sensing observations
added.&nbsp; On Sol 1039, ChemCam and Mastcam will take a look at targets
dubbed "Pistol," "Mary," Shepard," and "Dublin Gulch," and Navcam will
search for dust devils.&nbsp; Then the rover will drive
backward just a bit to get the wheels on solid ground and allow contact
science this weekend (planning is currently restricted, so we are
planning 2 sols today).&nbsp; On Sol 1038, Mastcam will take pictures of the
Sun to look for sunspots on the side of the Sun
that can't be seen from Earth now.&nbsp; Because I had little to do in
support of MAHLI planning today, I helped a bit in planning the
post-drive Navcam mosaics that we'll need to target observations in the
next plan.&nbsp;

<p>Over the weekend
holiday plan, Curiosity drove back to our location on Sol 992. Previous DAN and ChemCam data from this site showed some interesting results, so we want to investigate this region in more detail.&nbsp; The front Hazcam image above shows our wheel tracks from the last time we were here, and some of the bright outcrop that we want to study further.</p>
<p>Today’s two-sol plan includes remote sensing, a drive with several DAN active measurements, and post-drive imaging.&nbsp; The pre-drive science block includes ChemCam observations on targets named “Burke,” “Polson,” and “Bonner,” to look for chemical variations in the bright outcrop.&nbsp; We’ll also acquire Mastcam images of those targets, and take a large Mastcam mosaic to evaluate the sedimentary structures and to provide additional context.&nbsp; Then we’ll take a short drive with a few DAN active measurements along the way.&nbsp; After the drive we’ll take our standard post-drive imaging to prepare for targeting in future plans.&nbsp; Today’s plan also includes some ChemCam calibration activities as well as a Mastcam observation of the sun and Navcam imaging for environmental monitoring.&nbsp; It’s nice to be back in some familiar terrain and to have the chance to do even more science here!</p><p><span style="font-size: 13.5424003601074px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/lauren-edgar">Lauren Edgar</a></span></p>

Declaration of Independence at the start of today’s SOWG meeting: “When in the
course of human events, it becomes necessary to plan a 4 sol plan, we assemble
a group of patriots to make that plan. And that’s what we did today!”</p>
<p>Today I was back on duty as KOP and Ken was on duty for
ChemCam science. As usual, it was a busy planning day! After much discussion of
what to analyze with ChemCam, we decided to do a 3x3 measurement of the target “Snow
Bowl” to see if we could hit some large bright grains in the rock there (similar to the ones you can see in the MAHLI image above), as
well as a 3x3 observation of the “Lumpry” target that APXS analyzed yesterday.
We also had a Mastcam stereo mosaic of some of the nearby layered rocks. We
also have some Mastcam observations of the sun, and a Navcam observation
watching for clouds.</p>
<p>One of the trickiest things today was deciding how to
schedule our Mastcam and ChemCam observations so that no Mastcam images were
taken while ChemCam was turned on. (We try to avoid this because it makes
things a lot more complicated). The problem was, we wanted to use ChemCam do a “passive”
observation of the sky and then we were planning to do a coordinated
observation that involves taking Mastcam multispectral images before and after
zapping the target “Thunderbolt” with ChemCam. We solved the problem by moving
the “before” Mastcam images so that they occur at the same time of day, but on
the previous sol. That way we could go straight from the ChemCam sky observation
to zapping the rock target without having to do any Mastcam in between. Solving
challenges like this to maximize our science return is a lot of what is
involved in day-to-day rover planning.</p>
<p>On sol 1035, while we in the U.S. are celebrating Independence
Day, the rover will drive back toward where we were on Sol 991 while doing some
DAN measurements. Then on sol 1036 the rover will rest and recharge with a day
dedicated to routine REMS measurements.&nbsp;</p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By&nbsp;<a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

operations today, picking up where Lauren left off yesterday. Ken was helping
with ChemCam science in the geology and mineralogy (GeoMin) theme group, and I
was the GeoMin Keeper of the Plan (KOP). We started off the day admiring the
beautiful images from the sol 1031 “dog’s-eye view” mosaic of the ledge near
the target “Missoula”. Then there was a long discussion about where to do our
contact science, and in particular where to put APXS for an overnight
measurement. In the end, we decided to do a MAHLI mosaic of the target “Clark”,
just to the left of the “dog’s eye” mosaic from sol 1031, and then a MAHLI
observation of “Lumpry” which will also be the overnight APXS location.</p>
<p>That is followed by some Mastcam, starting with some carefully-timed
images of Phobos as it crosses in front of the sun. After that, we are planning
“multispectral” Mastcam observations of targets “Coombs”, “Cottonwood”, and “Lowary”.
Multispectral means that we take images of the same target through several
different color filters to get an idea of what the reflectance spectrum of the
rocks looks like. After all that Mastcam we also have a Navcam movie to search
for clouds, and a couple of Navcam images to allow more targeted Mastcam
tomorrow.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more! We also scheduled another MAHLI
observation of the target “Seeley” which is a rock that was broken by the rover’s
wheels. That is followed by ChemCam observations of “Coombs”, “Regis”, and “Spotted
Bear” and associated Mastcam documentation images.</p>
<p>That means that once planning for today was done, we were
both also involved in working on tomorrow’s plan, which will cover the long
holiday weekend. We will both be on duty tomorrow in the same roles, polishing
the plan we started today and making sure the rover is busy doing good science
over the weekend.</p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By&nbsp;<a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mars has passed through <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1824" target="_blank">solar conjunction</a>,
and reliable communication with the spacecraft at Mars is possible
again.&nbsp; As planning started this morning, we were still waiting for
more data to be relayed by the orbiters to confirm that MSL is ready to
resume science planning, but proceeded with
tactical planning so that we would be ready when the data arrived.&nbsp; The
Sol 1027 plan starts with Mastcam observations of several targets that
were imaged just before solar conjunction, to look for changes caused by
winds or maybe Marsquakes.&nbsp; Mastcam will
then look at the sun to measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere,
Navcam will search for dust devils, and ChemCam/Mastcam will observe
nearby targets "Piegan" and "Wallace."&nbsp; On Sol 1028, the arm will be
used to take MAHLI images of the rocks and soil
in front of the rover from various vantage points, to measure changes
in their reflectance with observation geometry ("photometry").&nbsp; After
dusk, APXS and MAHLI will measure 3 spots on a rock called "Big Arm"
that was imaged by MAHLI during the day before
solar conjunction.&nbsp; The nighttime images, using MAHLI's LEDs for
illumination, should nicely complement the daytime images of the rock.&nbsp;
Finishing off the weekend plan, on Sol 1029 ChemCam will acquire some
calibration data and Mastcam will take a stereo mosaic
of the <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NLB_486532425EDR_F0481570NCAM00323M_&amp;s=1003" target="_blank">outcrops to the east </a>of the rover.&nbsp;
</p><p>
As SOWG Chair today, I was a bit worried about
planning so many activities on the first day of tactical planning in a
few weeks, but the team hit the ground running and did a great job.&nbsp;
Early this afternoon, we got word from the downlink
team that the data acquired during conjunction show that the rover is
in good health, and that we were therefore "go" for planning.&nbsp; MSL is
back in action!</p><p>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff">Ken Herkenhoff</a></p>

</p><p>Today is the last day
of MSL tactical operations until after solar conjunction, so this will probably be the last MSL update for a few weeks.&nbsp; Ryan Anderson
and I are both on shift as payload uplink lead today, but because the
instruments we're representing
(ChemCam and MAHLI/MARDI, respectively) are already standing down in
preparation for conjunction, our efforts have been focused on planning for the
resumption of activities after conjunction.&nbsp; We don't know precisely
when tactical planning will resume, as the ability
to communicate with spacecraft as Mars passes behind the Sun depends on
variable solar activity.&nbsp; The expectation is that the next tactical
planning day will be June 25th (Sol 1026), but the schedule probably won't firm up until that week.&nbsp;
</p><p>
The Sol 1003 plan starts with Mastcam images of the
Sun to measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere, followed by
another set of Mastcam/Navcam photometry images to extend the experiment started on Sol 1000.&nbsp; Then Mastcam will take images of
various targets near the rover, to be compared with images of the same
targets taken after conjunction to look for changes caused by winds.&nbsp;
Later in the afternoon, the photometry and change-detection
imaging will be repeated, and Mastcam will acquire a stereo mosaic of
"<a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00997/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_486005036EDR_S0481570NCAM00275M_.JPG" target="_blank">Apikuni Mountain.</a>"&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then the focus motors of both Mastcams will be moved to their "home"
positions for conjunction and Navcam will search for clouds above MSL.&nbsp;
The Sol 1004 plan includes only the usual RAD and REMS observations, a
preview of the plan for the next few weeks.&nbsp;
During the break from tactical operations, the science team will have
more time to analyze the wealth of data the rover has returned over the
past 1000 sols.</p><p>by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff">Ken Herkenhoff</a></p>

are also planned--we want to image them before any dust is deposited on

<p>A short bump on Sol
997 put Curiosity in a great position to investigate a few different rock units in Marias Pass, using the instruments on the rover’s arm.&nbsp; The 2.5 m drive brings our total odometry to 10,599 m.&nbsp; With the upcoming solar conjunction (Mars will be on the opposite side of the sun from the Earth, so we can’t communicate with the rover for most of the month of June), Curiosity is now parked for the next few weeks. &nbsp;&nbsp;But we are parked in front of a <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NRB_485828206EDR_F0481530NCAM00274M_&amp;s=995" target="_blank">beautiful outcrop</a> that shows the contact between the underlying Pahrump unit and the overlying Stimson unit.</p>
<p>The goal of today’s
plan is to characterize the Stimson unit.&nbsp; First, Curiosity will acquire ChemCam and Mastcam on part of the Stimson unit called “Ronan” (the <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00995/mcam/0995ML0044030040404927E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">large block</a> in the top part of this Mastcam image) as well as a coarse-grained block named “Big_Arm.”&nbsp; Then we’ll acquire several MAHLI images on “Ronan.”&nbsp; Next, Curiosity will brush “Ronan” to remove the dust, and will then take MAHLI images of the brushed area to get a better look at the grain size and textures.&nbsp; And finally, we’ll place APXS on the target to investigate the bulk chemistry of “Ronan.”&nbsp; Tomorrow’s plan will likely include similar observations on the Pahrump unit.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/lauren-edgar">Lauren Edgar</a></span></p>

<p>Curiosity spent the weekend characterizing the terrain and bedrock exposed in Marias Pass.&nbsp; Curiosity drove 33 m further into Marias Pass, bringing our total odometry to 10,596 m.&nbsp;&nbsp; The drive set us up perfectly to investigate the contact between two different types of bedrock – the underlying Pahrump unit and the overlying Stimson unit.</p>
<p>Today’s plan is focused on characterizing the contact in this new location, and then bumping even closer to the outcrop to prepare for contact science later this week.&nbsp; Now that ChemCam is back in action with its <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1817" target="_blank">autonomous focusing capability</a>, the plan includes two ChemCam rasters on the targets “Mission” and “Missoula” to assess the chemistry on either side of the contact.&nbsp; The plan also includes some Mastcam mosaics to document the sedimentary structures, and a Navcam observation to search for dust devils.&nbsp; Then Curiosity will bump closer to the outcrop, and will acquire images for future targeting.&nbsp; Overnight, Curiosity will acquire Mastcam images of Phobos to study aerosols in the atmosphere of Mars.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/lauren-edgar">Lauren Edgar</a></span></p>

<p>After assessing a few different drive paths to deal with the challenging terrain, the team decided to drive uphill to avoid crossing the ripples near Jocko Butte.&nbsp; On Sol 990, Curiosity drove 52 m back towards Mt. Shields, which puts our total odometry at 10,533 m.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 0.92em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The goal of today’s plan is to climb uphill towards an interesting geologic contact.&nbsp; It’s the same contact that we would have seen in Logan Pass, but the path through “Marias Pass” looks a little bit shorter.&nbsp; Today’s plan also includes ChemCam and Mastcam observations of the target “Petty,” and Mastcam documentation of “Apikuni Mountain” and Mt. Shields to characterize the local geology.&nbsp; After the drive we’ll acquire some standard imaging to help with future targeting.</p>

weekend, Curiosity drove back toward “Jocko Butte”. Before the drive on sol
987, ChemCam had a 5x1 observation of the target “Mill”, accompanied by a
Mastcam image. Mastcam also took a small 2x2 mosaic of our tracks. </p>
<p>The drive back toward Jocko Butte was about 43 m, bringing our total odometry to 10,697 m. After the drive, Navcam and Mastcam took images to allow for targeted science and contact
science, and Navcam also had an atmospheric observation. On sol 988, we had several
“untargeted” observations, including some Mastcam measurements of the amount of
dust in the atmosphere, a Mastcam “clast survey” observation, and a MAHLI image
of the ground at our new location. </p>
<p>In today’s plan for sol 989, there is a ChemCam 3x3
observation on the target “Spokane”, and an accompanying APXS observation. (And
can I just say how nice it is to be able to rapidly analyze nine spots on a
target with ChemCam again?) Sol 989 also has a number of arm settling tests
with MAHLI that we want to get done before the upcoming conjunction (several
weeks when the sun is between the Earth and Mars, cutting off communications).
These tests help us to see how long it takes for vibrations in the rover’s arm
to disappear enough to allow good MAHLI images. Finally, APXS will be placed
back on Spokane for an overnight measurement.</p>
<p>After sol 989, we will be driving again, though where
exactly we will go is still being discussed. We want to get to the stratigraphic
contact at the base of “Mt. Stimson”, but it is proving to be difficult to
reach so we are also considering alternatives.&nbsp;</p><p>By <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

5x3 mosaic of Mt. Stimson and a 2x2 mosaic to fill a gap in a previous mosaic. </p>

tactical team decided to take a break from driving to allow various
options to be studied in more detail.&nbsp; The rover

nearby rock called "Una" to test the newly-installed ChemCam autofocus
software.&nbsp; Of course we are hoping this test goes well and that ChemCam

near the rover, and outcrops toward the south.&nbsp; The usual

</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 0.92em; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">So the plan for Sol 983
is to go around the ripples to the right and search for a safe path
ahead.&nbsp; But first, ChemCam will test its new focusing software, using
the RMI to find the best focus position for LIBS
analyses of the onboard calibration targets.&nbsp; The biggest challenge for
me as SOWG Chair today was prioritizing data for downlink, as the data
volume expected via MRO is much less than usual.&nbsp; We will probably
receive the images most urgently needed to plan
the next drive, but not the results of the ChemCam software tests.&nbsp;
This will delay the return of ChemCam to "normal" operations.&nbsp; But the near-term focus will likely be on driving, so
there will be few opportunities for ChemCam observations
anyway.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff">Ken Herkenhoff</a></span></p>

instead of the expected ~19 meters because Curiosity detected that its wheels
were slipping in the sand. The rover periodically takes pictures of its
surroundings while driving to make sure that it is actually moving forward and
its wheels are not just spinning in place. This was a lesson learned years ago
when the Opportunity rover got itself stuck in a sand ripple by spinning its wheels.
Curiosity currently is in no danger of getting stuck: in the weekend plan we
will just back up slightly and drive around the worst of the sand.</p>
<p>On Sol 980, before we drive, ChemCam and Mastcam will
analyze two targets, “Silver Valley” and “Snowslip” and Navcam will watch for
clouds above Mt. Sharp. Then on sol 981, Mastcam will take some pictures of the
crater rim and the sun to measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere. After
that comes the drive and our standard post-drive images so we can see our new
surroundings. Mastcam will also take a 7x2 mosaic of Logan Pass right after
driving.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of Sol 981, ChemCam will turn on so that
its software can be updated. I’ve really been looking forward to this update,
which will allow ChemCam to automatically focus using its camera, bringing us back to almost-normal operations!</p>
<p>On sol 982 there won’t be much activity, just some
maintenance activities for REMS.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

Chute” (our informal name for the saddle point west of Jocko Butte). In the sol
978 plan, we have a ChemCam LIBS observation of a patch of exposed bedrock
called “Big Salmon”, followed by lots of Mastcam images. There is a 14x3 mosaic
of some hills in the direction of our drive, some single frame high-resolution
images of the targets “Silvertip”, “White_Coyote”, and part of the wall of
“Logan Pass”. There is also a stereo Mastcam image of an outcrop called “White
Horse” and a 4x2 mosaic of Jocko Butte.</p>
<p>Once all that is done, we will drive toward “Logan Pass” and
do our standard post-drive imaging so we can see our new surroundings. On sol
979 ChemCam has a few calibration observations of targets on the rover, and
then Mastcam has an overnight observation of Phobos as it is eclipsed by Mars.
The idea of this observation is to take pictures of Phobos when it is
illuminated by the sun, and then when it is illuminated just by light passing
through Mars’ atmosphere, and compare them to figure out how much dust is in
the atmosphere.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

that, we will drive about 60 m, to a location west of “Jocko Butte”. After the

where we stop, as well as take pictures looking back from where we just were,
to view the outcrops from a different angle. Overnight, the SAM instrument will
measure the amount of noble gases in the atmosphere. On sol 977, ChemCam will

targets “Flathead”, “Fern”, “Ginsight”, and “High_Park”. A z-stack is when we
take a bunch of measurements at different focus positions. This allows us to
merge multiple images to make sure the entire field of view is in focus.
ChemCam also has a LIBS measurement of “Hungry_Horse”, which is accompanied by
a Mastcam image of the same target. Finally, Mastcam will attempt to take some
nighttime images of an eclipse of Mars’ moon Phobos, which can be used to infer
how the amount of dust in the martian atmosphere varies with altitude.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

<p>After cruising through Artist’s Drive, Curiosity set her sights on the next pass, known as “Logan Pass.” However, the science team realized that there’s an interesting outcrop to west of “Logan Pass,” which may help us to understand how these rocks relate to the section that we investigated at the Pahrump Hills.&nbsp; So we decided to make a run for it, and take a quick trip over to “Logan’s Run” to image those rocks first.</p>
<p>The plan today is to drive further to the west, and to do some additional MAHLI wheel imaging to monitor wheel wear.&nbsp; Prior to the drive we’ll acquire ChemCam and Mastcam observations on the target “Apple” – a small rock of variable tones.&nbsp; After the drive, we’ll acquire standard post-drive imaging for context and future target
selection.&nbsp; The plan also includes several Mastcam nighttime observations of Phobos and Deimos to investigate the opacity of the upper atmosphere and aerosol size.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/lauren-edgar">Lauren Edgar</a></span></p>

The Sol 960 drive went as planned, for a total of
over 102 meters!&nbsp; The rover has driven far enough since the last full
set of MAHLI images were acquired that it's time to take another full
set to look for more wheel wear.&nbsp; So my focus
today as MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead was on planning wheel images.&nbsp; MARDI
images are typically taken at each wheel-imaging position as well, but
all of these images were well planned strategically, so it was an easy
day for me.&nbsp; Wheel images will be taken at 4
spots, separated by short drives to ensure that all of the wheel
surfaces can be examined.&nbsp; This takes enough time that there wasn't much
room for other observations:&nbsp; Sol 962 begins with Mastcam mosaics of
<a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00960/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_482725854EDR_S0461676NCAM00431M_.JPG" target="_blank">distant outcrops</a>
and images of the Sun and sky.&nbsp; After the rover stops moving, Mastcam
and Navcam will&nbsp; take pictures of the terrain near the new rover
position, and the Left Navcam will image the sun just before it sets to
measure the distribution of dust in the atmosphere.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff">Ken Herkenhoff</a></span></p><p><small><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></small></p>

top of a small ridge, facing an outcrop dubbed “Daughter of the Sun”. The plan
for sol 959 is to do some ChemCam and Mastcam of targets “Gold” and “Espinoza”,
followed by several Mastcam mosaics. The biggest mosaic will be a 26x2 stereo
mosaic looking toward Logan Pass. We also have a 7x3 stereo mosaic of “Daughter
of the Sun” and a 17x1 mosaic of “West Ridge”.</p>
<p>On sol 960 we will do a long drive after which DAN will make
some measurements and we will take our standard post-drive images. Then on sol
961 ChemCam will take some calibration measurements and then Mastcam and Navcam
will make several atmospheric observations.</p>
<p>Speaking of taking pictures of the sky, we’re starting to
get data down from our observation of the Mercury sunset transit. So far all we
have are <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=0956MR0042290180502257I01_DXXX&amp;s=956">thumbnails</a>,

that was 10k measured by how many times the wheels have spun, not how far
across the surface of Mars the rover has gone. Now, no matter how you measure
it, we’ve gone 10,000 meters!).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we stopped with a ridge in
front of us, blocking the view. So the plan for sol 958 is to do a short drive to
get on top of the ridge so we can see farther to the south, allowing us to plan
more effectively for future drives (and enjoy the scenery). Before the drive,
we have some ChemCam passive observations of the sky to measure the composition
of the atmosphere. There is also a Mastcam mosaic of an outcrop to the east,
plus a high-resolution Mastcam observation of the target “Libby”. </p>
<p>After the drive, we will do some standard Navcam and Mastcam
imaging so we can do targeted science in our immediate surroundings, plus a
ChemCam calibration target observation, and a routine Mastcam “clast survey”

to SAM and analyzed by APXS, we are ready to keep driving. In the sol 956 plan,
there is a quick science block in the morning, to allow the rover to take a couple
of Mastcam pictures of nearby boulders called “Waucoba” and Navcam pictures to
complete the 360 degree panorama of the area. After that, we have a couple
hours of driving, which should take us into a new “quad” on our map of the
landing site. After the drive, Curiosity will take standard post-drive images
to allow us to make targeted observations in the sol 957 plan.</p>
<p>Later in the day there’s another science block, which will
be spent making some ChemCam observations of the onboard calibration targets.
Also in that science block, Mastcam will take a 3x2 mosaic in the direction of
sunset. The reason for these images is that we have a special observation at
sunset: Mastcam will be taking pictures of Mercury as it transits the sun,
right before the sun dips below the crater rim. This will be the last chance to
watch Mercury pass in front of the sun from Gale crater until 2024! Even
without a transit occurring, I always like <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_347.html">rover
sunset pictures</a>, so I’m looking forward to seeing how these observations

<p>MSL drove 18 meters on Sol 951, as planned, putting
the rover in position to image the terrain ahead and plan a longer
drive on Sol 952.&nbsp; The total "wheel odometry" for the MSL mission is now over 10 km!&nbsp; But the total traverse distance is still less than 10 km, because the wheels sometimes slip while driving, and the wheel odometry does not take slippage into account.&nbsp; So we're not quite ready to celebrate like the Mars Exploration project did when Opportunity recently completed the first extraterrestrial <a href="https://youtu.be/QltdZY485nk" target="_blank">marathon</a>.&nbsp; </p><p>The focus of scientific observation planning has been
to get good images of the terrain as we continue
driving, and before the Sol 952 drive the ChemCam RMI and Mastcam
stereo cameras will image various targets near and far.&nbsp; Almost 100
meters of driving is planned, with the rover initially going to the
right around the ripples shown <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00951/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_481929379EDR_F0451696NCAM00290M_.JPG" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; After the drive, in
addition to the normal images of the terrain near the rover, the Left
Mastcam will acquire a full 360-degree panorama.&nbsp; It was an easy day for

observations. We are planning two Mastcam mosaics looking at the layers in the
valley walls on either side of us, plus a routine “clast survey” image to
document the soil and gravel at our feet, plus an observation of a portion of
Mt. Sharp that is visible in the distance (which we have given the name “Tip Top
Mountain”, even though we can’t see the top of the mountain from where we are),
and a Mastcam image of the target “Joshua Tree.” It won’t be a purely
Mastcam-filled block though: ChemCam has two long-distance Remote Micro-Imager (RMI)
observations, also of “Tip Top Mountain” and “Joshua Tree.”</p>
<p>After the science block, the plan is to do a short drive to
a location that gives us a nice long-distance view to help with drive planning.
After the drive (and passing the 10k mark!), we will have our standard
post-drive imaging so that tomorrow we can do targeted science again. There is
also a post-drive Navcam movie to search for clouds and measure the wind
direction overhead.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

<p>Like most tourists who visit Artist’s Drive on Earth, Curiosity is busy taking lots of photos to document the valley walls of Artist’s Drive on Mars.&nbsp; We are officially on the road again, and working our way through a very scenic drive.<span style="font-size: 0.92em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I’m the Geology Science Theme Lead today, and today’s plan involves a pre-drive science block, a drive for hopefully ~30-40m, and some post-drive imaging for targeting.&nbsp; Unfortunately we have to be on a bit of a diet in terms of the total data volume that we can acquire.&nbsp; Back at Garden City we acquired a lot of really great data, and now we need to trim down so that we don’t acquire more data than we can downlink in a reasonable amount of time.&nbsp; The plan includes several large Mastcam mosaics to look at the stratigraphy exposed on the northwest and southeast valley walls, and post-drive Navcam mosaics to help select targets in the Sol 951 plan.&nbsp; We’ll also acquire Mastcam imaging to monitor atmospheric opacity.&nbsp; Tomorrow’s plan looks fairly similar to today – we’ll continue to drive and study the valley walls, taking time to appreciate the views along the way.<span style="font-size: 0.92em;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.92em;"><span style="font-size: 13.5424003601074px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/lauren-edgar">Lauren Edgar</a></span><br></span></p>

<p>As we started the planning
day before sunrise, I was reminded of the first three months of the mission that we spent living on Mars time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is an early “slide sol,” meaning that the planning timeline is shifted 1.5 hours earlier in order to compensate for our downlink and uplink times. Today is also a “tight” planning sol, meaning that the planning timeline is slightly shorter today. &nbsp;On top of that, we have a very complex set of activities planned for today!</p>
<p>Despite these restrictions, we certainly didn’t hold back on any science, and we developed a plan that uses almost the entire payload.&nbsp; I was the Geology Science Theme Lead today, and the goal today is to wrap up contact science on the veins at Garden City.&nbsp; The plan includes ChemCam observations on a dark vein and a plate that looks like it broke off from a vein, followed by Mastcam documentation.&nbsp; Then we’ll acquire a large MAHLI mosaic to assess the morphology of one of the prominent veins, seen in this <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=0946MR0041570020502003E01_DXXX&amp;s=946" target="_blank">Mastcam image</a> from Sol 946.&nbsp; In the evening we’ll do a short APXS integration on the target “Amboy,” and then a longer overnight integration on the target “Kern_Peak” (“Kern_Peak” is the flat plate near the middle of this

quickly and should be back to normal operations this weekend.&nbsp; But
without some key MSL data this morning, it was more difficult than usual
to plan arm activities.&nbsp; Despite valiant efforts by the Rover Planners

of dust and ice in the atmosphere at night.&nbsp; After dawn, more Mastcam
(plus Navcam and ChemCam) observations of the sky are planned for

Two more sets of MAHLI wheel images will be taken on Sol 940 before the
rover drives south toward a rock dubbed "Kanosh."&nbsp;
Because less data than normal are expected to be received in time for

extra effort was put into prioritizing various post-drive datasets.&nbsp;
CheMin will perform another mineralogical analysis on the Telegraph Peak
drill sample overnight,
then Navcam and Mastcam will observe the horizon early on the morning
of Sol 941.&nbsp;

The plan includes MAHLI and APXS on the veins, and some ChemCam and
Mastcam observations to look for variations in chemistry.&nbsp; Curiosity will also perform a number of
environmental monitoring activities to measure atmospheric composition and
opacity, and search for dust devils.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although we were disappointed that the weekend plan didn’t execute as we
had hoped, the images that we’ve received so far show that this is a

The MAHLI team was well prepared for contact
science today, but had to scramble to react to news early this morning
that the right front wheel is perched on a small rock and therefore is
not in a safe position for arm contact with the surface.&nbsp;
We had originally planned to brush a potential APXS target with the
Dust Removal Tool (DRT) and take MAHLI images of the brushed spot.&nbsp; But
the DRT activity had to be deleted, and MAHLI reconnaissance imaging of
another potential APXS target added to the plan.&nbsp;
This made for a hectic morning for me and the other MAHLI uplink leads,
but we are happy with how the plan turned out.&nbsp; On Sol 930, ChemCam and
Mastcam will observe an outcrop target named "Swasey" before the arm
will be used to acquire MAHLI images of the
bright and dark rocks shown in the lower left part of <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00926/mcam/0926MR0040720010501730E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">this image</a>.&nbsp;
These MAHLI images will be useful in planning future scientific
observations.&nbsp; The APXS will then be placed close to a dark patch for
overnight integration.&nbsp; None of
the MAHLI or APXS activities includes surface contact, so they are safe even
with the rock under the right front wheel.&nbsp; Early on the morning of Sol
931, the left Navcam will be used to search for dust devils and clouds
as part of an ongoing experiment to determine
how these atmospheric phenomena vary with time of day.&nbsp; Mastcam images
of the terrain ahead are planned around noon,
followed by MAHLI imaging of another APXS target late in the afternoon.
Then the APXS will hover near the surface for another overnight
integration.&nbsp; Planning is "restricted" this week, so the next tactical planning will occur on Friday.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff">Ken Herkenhoff</a></span></p><p><small><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></small></p>

<p>Over the weekend,
Curiosity bumped closer to the target “Garden City” located in “Artist’s

<p>Today’s plan is
focused on characterizing “Garden City” and getting ready for contact science
on Wednesday.&nbsp; The plan includes ChemCam
observations on the targets “Ouray” and “Hoskinnini” to characterize the
composition of the light and dark parts of the veins, as well as several
Mastcam multispectral observations.&nbsp;
There are also several Navcam and Mastcam activities to monitor
atmospheric opacity and search for dust devils.&nbsp;
Furthermore, this plan includes several important SAM activities to
prepare for and analyze the previously acquired “Telegraph Peak” sample.</p>

On Mars,
the rover stopped its drive early because it detected that its wheels were
slipping in the sand, so we weren’t where we expected to be and we had to
adjust our observations accordingly. At the same time on Earth, some network
issues at JPL made it difficult for many of us to connect to the tools that we
use to do our planning. Luckily those issues didn’t start up until the planning
for Sol 924 was pretty far along, so we were still able to get a good plan put
together.</p>
<p>On sol 924, ChemCam analyzed a layered rock target called “Hennefer”,
and Mastcam took a supporting image. Mastcam also took a mosaic of the outcrop
we are heading toward, called “Garden City”, as well as a small mosaic of the
sand ripple (called “Tropic Ripple”) near where we stopped, and a mosaic of a
tiny crater that we called “Hemicyon Basin.” </p>
<p>After that, the rover continued on its drive toward Garden
City. After the drive, ChemCam did a calibration measurement, MAHLI took an
image from its stowed position, and Mastcam took a 2x1 mosaic looking back
across the floor of Gale crater toward the “Peace Vallis” alluvial fan. Mastcam
and Navcam also had some atmospheric observations, and Mastcam and Navcam also
took some standard post-drive mosaics.</p>
<p>This morning things were a lot smoother. We started off
planning ogling the beautiful images of the Garden City outcrop, which is
cris-crossed with erosion resistant ridges. The plan for sol 925 is to do a
ChemCam analysis and associated Mastcam mosaic on one of the nearby ridges
called “San Timoteo”, along with a Mastcam stereo mosaic of Garden City. Later
in the day, ChemCam has an observation of a dark rock to test some focusing
settings on a very dark target. Then CheMin will do an overnight analysis on
the sample that it is currently working on. </p>
<p>On the morning of sol 926m ChemCam has some passive observations
of the sky, and Mastcam and Navcam also have some atmospheric measurements.
Then the rover will do a short drive toward Garden City, followed by standard
imaging plus some extra Navcams of the hill that is rising above us.</p>
<p>Finally on sol 927, Mastcam and Navcam have some more
atmospheric measurements.</p>
<p>Next week many of us on the science team will be at the
Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, but we will also be eagerly checking in
on what Curiosity is doing at the tantalizing Garden City outcrop.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">by Ryan Anderson</span></p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">-Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

where we can do “full MAHLI wheel imaging” in the coming sols.</p>
<p>During the drive, the rover will stop long enough for
Mastcam to get an image of the drill tailings to document where we placed the
APXS overnight. We’ll also get a Mastcam image of a wind-blown ripple to see
what the grain sizes are. After the drive, we have Mastcam observations of the
candidate contact science target “Garden City” along with routine post-drive
images from Navcam. &nbsp;There will also be
several standard environmental monitoring measurements.</p>

placed the rover in a good position for detailed study of the outcrop of
interest, as we all hoped.&nbsp; The plan that
will take the rover through the weekend is, in the words of the SOWG
Chair Doug Ming, "jam-packed" with science observations.&nbsp; The MSL
tactical team is focused on examination of an outcrop target called
"Telegraph Peak" to determine whether it is suitable
for drilling.&nbsp; On Sol 905, MAHLI will take pictures of Telegraph Peak
before it is cleaned off by the brush.&nbsp; Mastcam and ChemCam will then
observe the brushed target before the arm is used to acquire a full
suite of MAHLI images, two APXS measurements, and
test the strength of the target by pushing the drill assembly against
it.&nbsp; Finally, the APXS will be placed on Telegraph Peak again for
overnight integrations.&nbsp; In parallel, starting around midnight, SAM will perform a static test of its quadrupole mass spectrometer.&nbsp;
</p><p>
The next morning, the arm will be moved out of the
way to allow ChemCam and Mastcam observations of nearby targets "Brazer"
and "Crazy Hollow."&nbsp; Later in the afternoon, when lighting will be
better for some distant targets, Mastcam will
acquire a couple of mosaics.&nbsp; Just after sunset, now that the rover is in a
new location, MARDI will acquire an image of the ground near the left
front wheel.&nbsp; Only a few activities are planned for Sol 907, including
another Mastcam mosaic and a Navcam search for
dust devils, to allow the rover's batteries to recharge in preparation
for possible drilling on Sol 908.

day weekend. We humans get a long weekend, but the rover has a lot of work to
do! We were supposed to drive about 45 meters in the previous plan, but the
data received this morning showed that the rover stopped after only 17 meters.
I was on duty as the ChemCam science Payload Uplink Lead (sPUL) today, and in
the science theme group meeting we were worried that the short drive would
cause a major change in the plan, but it turned out not to be a problem. The
rover drivers understand why the rover stopped early and had no concerns about
simply continuing the drive in today’s plan. Even better, there was enough room
in the plan to do the drive without changing how much time we had to do science!</p>
<p>The location where the rover stopped was mostly flat bedrock
and large sand ripples: not where we planned to stop, but still plenty of
science to do. On sol 899, ChemCam will analyze the target “Osiris” and on Sol
900 ChemCam will analyze “Garley.” Both of these targets are patches of
bedrock, so the chemistry data, when combined with the many other observations
of bedrock over the last few weeks and months, will help understand how the
rocks change throughout the stratigraphic section. </p>
<p>Mastcam has an 8x3 mosaic of Osiris on Sol 899, which seems
to have some fine layering that is barely visible in Navcam. On sol 900 Mastcam
also will take a documentation image of Garley, a 2x2 mosaic of a layered rock
near the rover called “Sneakover” (because it was snuck into the plan at the
last minute), and a 2x2 mosaic of “Hermosa,” where the rover tracks cross a
sand ripple.</p>
<p>On sol 901, ChemCam will make some passive (no laser)
measurements of the sky, and then Curiosity will resume the drive that was cut
short. After the drive, we have standard imaging to get our bearings, plus a
Mastcam 360 degree mosaic and a Navcam cloud observation. The DAN instrument
will do an active measurement after the drive to characterize the amount of
light elements (such as the hydrogen in water) under the rover in the new
location. And finally, ChemCam will do some routine measurements of the
calibration targets.</p>
<p>On sol 902, the rover gets a bit of a rest, with just
routine environmental measurements by RAD and REMS.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">--Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

kicked off to a great start, with the SOWG Chair (Aileen Yingst) reminding us
that we do have the coolest job in the world.&nbsp;
I’m the Geology Theme Lead today, and it certainly feels like an
exciting job.&nbsp; In this plan we’ve managed
to use almost every instrument onboard the rover to characterize the most
recent drill sample and the surrounding environment.&nbsp; First we’ll dump the post-sieve sample, and
then we’ll “thwack” and vibrate CHIMRA (the Collection and Handling for in-Situ
Martian Rock Analysis) to clean out any remnants of the sample.&nbsp; Later in the plan we’ll use MAHLI and APXS to
characterize the grain size and composition of the dump pile, and Mastcam to document
the pile with all of the camera filters.&nbsp;
We’ll also use ChemCam to assess a nearby vein, and MAHLI will carry out
some nighttime imaging of the drill hole and CheMin inlet.&nbsp; We don’t often mention it in our blogs, but
every sol we’re also collecting RAD, REMS and DAN data for radiation
assessment, environmental monitoring, and neutron detection.&nbsp; Meanwhile the SAM instrument is patiently
waiting to analyze the samples that we “doggie bagged” a few sols ago. &nbsp;I like this </span><a style="font-size: 0.92em; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;" href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=FRB_476687033EDR_F0450000FHAZ00323M_&amp;s=892" target="_blank">Front Hazcam image</a><span style="font-size: 0.92em; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"> that came down over the weekend – I feel like Curiosity’s shadow is striking a

Mojave2 drill sample to the SAM instrument, and some remote sensing activities
with Mastcam, ChemCam and Navcam.&nbsp; The
samples that we’re dropping off to SAM can be thought of as “doggie bags”
because we’ll take the sample with us for analysis at a later time.&nbsp; The first sol of the weekend plan also
includes several atmospheric monitoring activities with Navcam and
Mastcam.&nbsp; The second sol includes a
number of ChemCam observations to assess the chemistry of a soil target and
perform some instrument calibration activities.&nbsp;
The third sol is devoted to ChemCam and Mastcam observations of an
interesting vein target named “San Francisquito” to assess its chemistry and test
ChemCam autofocusing in low light conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

MSL's batteries are almost fully
charged, so the Sol 890 plan includes another CheMin measurement of the
"Mojave2" drill sample.&nbsp; CheMin and SAM require more power than the
other instruments, but we want to better understand the mineral
composition of the drill sample before we dump the rest of the sample
and drive away, so these observations have high priority.&nbsp; In addition,
ChemCam and Mastcam observations of a nearby target named "Searles" are
planned, along with images of distant targets.&nbsp; I'm not scheduled SOWG
Chair today, but of course I wanted to call in to the operations
teleconference to see how things are going, and was glad to see that the
Sol 889 activities we planned yesterday completed successfully.&nbsp; For
example, this ChemCam <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00889/soas/rdr/ccam/CR0_476409159PRC_F0450000CCAM02889L1.PNG" target="_blank">RMI image</a> shows the hole the laser made in the

to ensure that I was familiar with the goals for Sol 887.&nbsp; Most people

I definitely felt that it was worthwhile to do as much as possible
while MSL is active on the surface of Mars.&nbsp; The activities planned for
Sols 885-886 went well, and we received images showing that the plasma
"plumes" created by the ChemCam laser blew holes
in the pile of drill tailings (e.g., just right of center in the <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00883/mcam/0883MR0038510020501184E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">image</a> above<a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00883/mcam/0883MR0038510020501184E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank"></a>).&nbsp;

flight software upgrade! Today we received some very nice MAHLI images of the
target “Mojave2“ that the rover brushed on sol 880. We also got the results of
our “preloading” test, where the drill is pushed against the rock to make sure
it isn’t going to shift as we drill. Mojave2 looks nice and stable, so the main
activity in the 881 plan is to do a “mini-drill” in this location. Last time we
tried mini-drilling at “Mojave”, we broke the rock apart, so we’re all waiting
eagerly to see if Mojave2 is better behaved. Other than the mini drill and
various documentation images, the main activity for sol 881 is an overnight
APXS measurement of the drill hole.</p>
<p>I was on duty today as “Keeper of the Plan” (KOP) for the
geology theme group, which means I help the geologists on the team translate
their desired science into a set of activities scheduled at specific times.
Usually, the plan for a sol has a “science block” where the science team can
put any observations that will fit. Today was a little different: because we’re
doing the mini-drill, there isn’t any room for a science block, so it was an
easy day to be KOP. If the mini-drill goes well, there won’t be any science
blocks in the sol 882 plan either, since we will be busy doing a full drill
hole, but if the mini-drill breaks the rock again, the full drilling might be
canceled. If that happens, we need to have a plan for what else to do, so that
was what the geology group focused on today. This way, we will make the most of
sol 882 even if we can’t drill!</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></span></p><p style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">--Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

in case the software transition had to be aborted, but so far it is
going well so the science

some science done before we begin a week of no activity while the engineering
team upgrades the rover software. The plan is to do two ChemCam “rasters” on
targets “Funk Valley” and “Rainbow Basin”. Each raster will analyze three
closely-spaced spots on the target. Funk Valley is our latest candidate
mini-drill target (our last mini-drill ended up <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/news/astrogeology/sols-869-870-broken-rock" target="_blank">breaking the rock</a>, so we’re
trying again), and Rainbow Basin is a rock with some interesting
erosion-resistant knobs. Mastcam will take supporting images of these targets
and then we will be spending a pretty big chunk of time doing some data
management for Mastcam, transferring less-compressed versions of some images
from Mastcam’s internal memory over to the rover prior to the flight software
update. The last activity on sol 871 will be an overnight analysis of the chunk
of rock that our first mini-drill dislodged, using APXS. This is a rare chance
to do APXS on a target with a fresh, non-dusty surface!</p>
<p>On sol 872, ChemCam will do some passive observations of the
sky to measure how much oxygen, carbon dioxide, and dust is in the atmosphere
and Navcam will do some routine atmospheric measurements. There are also a
bunch of Mastcam images of the same locations at different times of the day.
These are part of a photometry experiment, which is trying to understand how
the sun scatters off of the martian surface at different angles. There are also
a handful of Mastcam images as part of a change monitoring campaign. The long
break for the software update will allow us to look at the same locations in a
couple weeks and see if any sand has been moved by the wind.</p>
<p>If all goes according to plan, there won’t be a lot of rover
activity over the next week, but the team will be busy poring over the <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?s=869&amp;camera=MAHLI" target="_blank">latest
MAHLI images</a> of our drilling area and the chunks that were dislodged during our

<div class="description">
<p><span style="font-size: 0.92em; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">This morning the MSL
operations team realized that the results of the MAHLI activities
planned for Sol 870 will not be received until Saturday.&nbsp; Therefore, if
there is a problem on Sol 870 that halts the sequence
while the MAHLI dust cover is open, the cover would remain open through
the Martin Luther King holiday weekend.&nbsp; To eliminate the risk of such a
situation and possible effects on the software upgrade planned for next
week, the team decided not to send the
Sol 870 command sequences to the rover.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this means that
the brushing and drill target investigations planned yesterday will not
occur, but they can be done after the software has been upgraded. The Sol 869 activities planned yesterday will not be affected by this change, and should be completed today.</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, many of the MAHLI self portrait images
acquired on Sol 868 have been received.&nbsp; When all of them have been
returned to Earth, they will be assembled into the latest rover

that the rotary-percussive drilling fractured the rock.&nbsp; This was not
expected, so the tactical team had to quickly change the Sol 869-870
plan.&nbsp; While we were hoping to drill a deeper hole and acquire a sample
of the drill cuttings before the upgrade of the software onboard the rover next week, the rock fragments dislodged by the mini-drill
activity provided a rare opportunity to examine freshly-broken
surfaces.&nbsp; Field geologists usually carry rock hammers so that they can
break rocks and examine the fresh surfaces.&nbsp; On Mars, the
drill has served as MSL's rock hammer!&nbsp; So the Sol 869 plan includes
ChemCam measurements of the fresh chunk of rock and the bottom of the
mini-drill hole, followed by MAHLI close-up images of the dislodged
rocks, both during the day and at night (illuminated
by the LEDs).&nbsp; On Sol 870, the brush will be used to clean off another
potential mini-drill target, dubbed "Funk Valley."&nbsp; MAHLI images of this
new target will be taken before and after the brushing, then the drill
will be "preloaded" (pushed down) against
Funk Valley and a potential full drill target to determine whether the
rock is strong enough to safely drill.&nbsp; Finally, MAHLI images will be
acquired to see the results of the preload tests and the APXS will be placed on the brushed spot for an overnight integration.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.92em; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff">Ken Herkenhoff</a></span><br></span></p>

the Sol 864 plan we will be doing a very short drive (called a “bump”) toward
our drilling target: “Mojave” (shown above). Before the drive, ChemCam will analyze 5
locations in a line across a possible mineral vein in the rock, at a target
called “Harrisburg”. This type of observation, called a “raster”, was
quite common before ChemCam’s focus problems, but this will be the first time
doing a 5-point raster since the focusing laser stopped working. ChemCam is
still collecting images and spectra at multiple focus positions per point, to
make sure we get good data. </p>
<p>After Harrisburg, ChemCam will also study a broken rock
target called “Beers”, where it will take spectra and several stacks of images
at different focus positions. This will provide good data for testing the
focus, plus interesting science data from the freshly exposed portion of the
broken rock. Mastcam will provide supporting images for both ChemCam observations,
plus an image of a location where the rover ran over a small sand ripple, at a
target called “Doughnut”. (I promise, Homer Simpson did not name our targets
today!) Navcam will also do a dust devil search.</p>
<p>After that, the rover will drive about 10 meters to get into
position for drilling, and we will take Mastcam and Navcam images of the
surroundings. On Sol 865, our main activity is a measurement of methane in the
atmosphere by SAM (Sample Analysis at Mars – the onboard chemistry lab).</p>
<p>And then on Sol 866, we have some routine atmospheric
observations by ChemCam, Mastcam, and Navcam.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></span></p><p style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em>--Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px; font-size: 12px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em>

After driving, we will do our standard post-drive imaging with Navcam and
Mastcam to get a good look at our surroundings. </p>
<p>On Sol 863, Mastcam will look at the sun to measure how much
dust is in the atmosphere (this measurement is called a “tau” because that’s
the symbol used in the equation that shows how much the sun’s light is
attenuated). Navcam will watch for clouds above Mt. Sharp, and ChemCam will
make a passive sky observation. ChemCam will also make some measurements of the

planning two days at a time. The main priority for the sol 860 plan is to use
MAHLI to take close-up color images of the targets “Sierra Nevada”, “Santa Ana,”
and “Tecoya”. These targets were analyzed by APXS over the holidays, so it’s
important to get good images to go with the chemistry.</p>
<p>For sol 861, ChemCam will analyze the Tecoya target, and a
target called “Last Chance Canyon”. ChemCam will also take a series of images
of “Newberry” to test focusing at long range. Mastcam will take color images of
Newberry and Last Chance Canyon to support the ChemCam observations. The rest
of Sol 861 will be Mastcam images of targets “Telescope Peak,” “Fairview
Valley,” and “Gem Hill” as part of a campaign to watch for any changes in the
images. Mastcam will also make a routine “clast survey” observation, where it
looks at a patch of ground near the rover to study the sizes of the pebbles and
rocks (collectively called “clasts”). Clast surveys are done periodically to get an idea of how the clasts change throughout the traverse.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></span></p><p style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"><em>--Ryan is a planetary scientist at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and a member of the ChemCam team on MSL.</em></p><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px; font-size: 12px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em>

sequences were successfully received by Curiosity, and all the data
needed for planning were returned to Earth, including MAHLI images of the right
front wheel. These and other data were thoroughly analyzed, and the slip risk
assessment team concluded that it is safe to brush the target "Santa
Ana."&nbsp; So after multiple remote sensing ChemCam and Mastcam observations
on Sol 843 and 844, the Dust Removal Tool will be
used late in the afternoon on Sol 844.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To give the MSL tactical team a break next week, we
are planning 10 (!) sols today.&nbsp; Essentially, it's a normal 3-sol weekend
plan, with only REMS and associated background activities for the rest
of the plan.&nbsp; Because we don't want to risk
leaving the MAHLI dust cover open in the unlikely event of an arm
fault, no MAHLI activities are included in the plan.&nbsp; So it was an easy
day for me as MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead; I simply suggested Mastcam 100 mm
imaging of the brushed spot in lieu of the usual
MAHLI documentation images.&nbsp; After the Mastcam image is acquired, the
APXS will be placed on Santa Ana for an overnight integration.&nbsp; A full
multispectral Mastcam observation (all filters, both eyes) of the
brushed spot is planned just after noon on Sol 845,
when the illumination will be better for measuring subtle spectral features.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff">Ken Herkenhoff</a></span></p>

841 command sequences could not be sent to MSL because of a transmitter
problem at the <a href="http://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html" target="_blank">Deep Space Network</a> (DSN) antenna.&nbsp;
This reminded me not to take for granted communications between Earth
and Mars, even though such problems are rare.&nbsp; Bad weather over a DSN
station can prevent transmission or receipt of radio signals.&nbsp; Because
of such risks, every bundle of command sequences
sent to the Mars rovers includes a few sols' worth of "runout"
sequences.&nbsp; These tell the rover what to do if new commands are not
received.&nbsp; So MSL is safe and healthy, but not doing much on Sol 841
besides sending more data back to Earth (through the Mars
orbiters, as usual).&nbsp; </p>
<p>As you might expect, the Sol 842 plan includes most
of the observations planned for Sol 841.&nbsp; But the arm activities had to
be moved earlier to ensure that the MAHLI images of the right front
wheel will be received on Earth in time for
weekend planning on Friday.&nbsp;
These images should help determine whether it is safe to brush using
the Dust Removal Tool.&nbsp; To make room for the arm activities before the
critical MRO data relay, Mastcam observations of targets dubbed
"Telescope Peak," "Fairview
Valley," "Gem Hill," and "Juniper Hills" were moved later, after the
MRO communications pass.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">by <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ken-herkenhoff">Ken Herkenhoff</a></span></p>

Sol 840 MAHLI targets,

rock under the right front wheel during brushing.&nbsp; Such slippage might
damage the Dust Removal Tool, but MAHLI imaging is safe (as it was on

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">After a successful investigation of the Chinle outcrop, Curiosity is ready to move on to the Whale Rock outcrop. &nbsp;Today we are planning two sols, and on the first sol we’ll finish up a few last targeted observations at Chinle. &nbsp;The plan includes a ChemCam passive observation of the target Goldstone (“passive” means that we don’t fire the laser, we just passively collect the spectrum of the target), along with a Mastcam image to document the target. &nbsp;We’ll also acquire a ChemCam z-stack on the target Cucumongo to test out a new template for ChemCam activities, and to look for any changes in chemistry compared to other observations at Chinle (z-stack means that we’ll acquire data from several different focus positions). &nbsp;There’s also a Navcam activity to search for dust devils and monitor the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">After we complete our morning science observations, Curiosity will attempt a rather difficult drive toward Whale Rock. &nbsp; Curiosity was last at Whale Rock on Sol 796, and captured this tantalizing <a href="/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=6870" target="_blank">image of cross-bedding</a>. &nbsp;We want to go back to Whale Rock to investigate the small-scale textures and composition of the outcrop using the instruments on the rover’s arm (MAHLI and APXS). &nbsp;But in order to do that, we need to get close to the rocks, and the terrain looks quite challenging. &nbsp;One way to work around the difficult approach is to sample a float rock (a block that has broken off from the main outcrop and might be in a more accessible position). &nbsp;Due to the difficult terrain, it might take us a few drives to get into a good position.</p>
<p class="p1">After the drive we’ll acquire Navcam and Mastcam images, which we’ll use to select interesting targets and plan future drives. &nbsp;On the second sol Curiosity will also acquire a Navcam observation to monitor the atmosphere above Mt. Sharp. &nbsp;Fingers crossed for a good drive!</p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14.7200002670288px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/lauren-edgar">Lauren Edgar</a></span></p>

planning for sols 833 and 834, NASA held a press conference to share some of
the results of our recent investigations in the Murray formation, in the
foothills of Mt. Sharp. The layered rocks that we have been observing tell the
story of a series of shallow lakes with small deltas formed by sediment
deposited from the crater rim. Check out the </span><a style="font-size: 0.92em; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;" href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1761">press
release</a><span style="font-size: 0.92em; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;"> for more details!</span></p>
<p>In the Sol 833-834 plan, we are planning to do three ChemCam
“Z-stack” observations of the target “Vaqueros” which looks like it might be a
white mineral-filled vein. Z-stack observations are when the instrument
collects data from the same location at several different focus positions. We are
planning Z-stacks with ChemCam’s black-and-white camera and the main
spectroscopy laser to make sure that we get good data from the target, and to
collect information to develop new focusing methods for ChemCam. </p>
<p>Later on sol 833, the high-resolution color camera on the
arm (MAHLI – Mars Hand Lens Imager) will collect some images of the fine
details of the layers in the Chinle outcrop, at targets called “Coachella” and “Tropico”.
Then we will measure the chemical composition of Tropico with the APXS (Alpha
Particle X-Ray Spectroscopy) instrument on the arm.</p>
<p>On Sol 834, Navcam (the black and white Navigation cameras)
and Mastcam (the mast-mounted color science cameras) will take some atmospheric
observations to measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere.</p><p><span style="font-size: 13.5424003601074px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">By <a href="http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/people/ryan-anderson">Ryan Anderson</a></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Well it was an exciting day for space exploration!&nbsp; As we were working operations this morning many space enthusiasts on the team were keeping tabs on the launch and splashdown of the Orion capsule – the new spacecraft that might someday take astronauts to Mars.&nbsp; It was fun to think about future human exploration on Mars as we were putting together our rover plan for the day.&nbsp; It was also great to have all three USGS bloggers working together today.&nbsp; I was on duty as the Geology and Mineralogy Science Theme Lead and Ryan was the Keeper of the Plan, so collectively we assembled the geology tasks that Curiosity will carry out over the weekend (Sols 830-832).&nbsp; Ken was the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) Payload Uplink Lead today, meaning that he was responsible for the details of all of the MAHLI activities (figuring out the right pointing, standoff distance, priorities etc. to get good high-resolution images using the camera on the end of the rover’s arm).&nbsp; And we certainly gave Ken a lot of work to do today!&nbsp; The plan includes contact science (using the instruments on the rover’s arm) on the targets “Pickhandle” and “Goldstone” to characterize the lower and middle parts of the Chinle outcrop.&nbsp; First we’ll use the Dust Removal Tool to clean off a fresh surface at “Goldstone” (we cleaned off “Pickhandle in the Sol 828 plan).&nbsp; This <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=0828MH0001970010301721C00_DXXX&amp;s=828" target="_blank">MAHLI image</a> from Sol 828 shows “Goldstone” before brushing. &nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">Then we’ll acquire several MAHLI images on each target, taken at different distances and offsets to get both context and stereo imaging.&nbsp; Then we’ll place the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) on “Goldstone” to figure out the bulk chemical composition. &nbsp; On the third sol of the weekend plan, we’ll move the arm out of the way and use ChemCam and Mastcam to characterize the targets that we brushed.&nbsp; The plan also includes some extra Mastcam imaging to make a nice mosaic of the outcrop, several observations of the ChemCam calibration targets, and a Navcam observation to monitor the atmosphere above Mount Sharp.&nbsp; I love these days when we get to use so many different instruments to characterize a place on Mars!</span></p><p><small><em>Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></small></p>

<p>Today all three USGS bloggers were on MSL operations! I was
on duty as the Science Payload Downlink Lead (sPDL) for ChemCam, meaning that
it was my job to check all of the science data that we received to make sure
the data looks good and to do a quick analysis of the results. Lauren was the
Keeper of the Plan (KOP) for the geology theme group, meaning that she helped
put together the plan of geology tasks that the rover will do in the Sol
828-829 plan (a sol is a Mars day). And Ken was the Science Operations Working
Group (SOWG) chair, meaning that he led the SOWG meeting and made sure that the
plan satisfied the goals of the science team while also staying within the
constraints on power, data, safety, complexity, etc.</p>
<p>This morning was a little more “exciting” than normal because
bad weather on Earth caused a disruption in our downlink of data from Mars, so
for a little while it looked like we would not have any of the images from the
end of the drive to help us plan sols 828-829. (We can’t do much if we don’t
know what the rover’s surroundings look like!) It also meant that our ChemCam
data was missing. But in the end, the data did arrive so that I could assess
the ChemCam data and planning could proceed.</p>
<p>On sol 828, ChemCam will do a passive observation of the sky
to measure the abundance of different molecules in the atmosphere, and Navcam (the
navigation cameras) will take a movie to watch for clouds forming over Mt.
Sharp. Also in the morning block, Mastcam has a mosaic of the <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NLB_470822426EDR_F0442062NCAM00353M_&amp;s=826">“Chinle”
outcrop</a> to look at the fine-scale layering.</p>
<p>Later on the same sol, there are a series of observations of
Chinle by MAHLI (the Mars Hand Lens Imager – a close-up, high-resolution color
camera). These observations will look at the layers in Chinle from a different
angle and at a higher resolution than is possible with the mast cameras. While
the arm is out, we will also brush off the target “Pickhandle” on Chinle using
the Dust Removal Tool (DRT).</p>
<p>On Sol 829, Mastcam will do a routine “clast survey”
observation to characterize the loose rocks near the rover, and ChemCam will
run a diagnostic test of the focusing laser that has been acting up recently.</p>

<p>The activities planned for the Thanksgiving holiday went well, and the data received so far look good, including <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00824/mhli/0824MH0001530000301606R00_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">MAHLI images</a>
showing the brushed target "Puente."&nbsp; So we are ready to move on, and
the Sol 826 plan includes a few ChemCam and Mastcam observations before a
drive to the "Chinle" area.&nbsp; We were also able to squeeze another MAHLI
image of the APXS calibration target into
the plan, to look for possible changes in dust on the target caused by
the long overnight APXS integration on Sols 825-6.&nbsp; Planning is
"restricted" again this week because of the offset between Mars time and
Pacific Standard Time, so we are planning two sols
today.&nbsp; We can plan only untargeted remote sensing observations on Sol
827 because of the drive on the previous sol, as we won't know the rover
position precisely until Wednesday.&nbsp; I'm SOWG Chair today, and it has been a fairly easy day for me so far.&nbsp;

plan for sols 809-811. The main activity for sol 809 is using Curiosity’s arm
to brush off the target “Mojave” followed by supporting images with Mastcam and
MAHLI and measurements with APXS. On sol 810, Mastcam has two mosaics in the
morning, one of which is a re-shoot of the “Pink Cliffs” mosaic from sol 808,
but taken in the late afternoon this time so that the low angle of the lighting
highlights the textures. In the evening there is another round of contact
science. We will brush the dust off of the target “Potatoe” (which, despite
what you may think, was not named by Dan Quayle), and do several APXS
measurements along with MAHLI images. MAHLI will also take some pictures of the
target “Pilot Knob Valley”. On sol 811, science mostly has the day off after a
couple of late nights of APXS and MAHLI, and the main activity is an
engineering test of the backup computer on Curiosity to make sure that it can
be used as the primary computer if that ever becomes necessary.</p><p><em style="line-height: 22.0799999237061px; font-size: 12px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></p>

Curiosity was still busy! The sol 806 plan had a pretty simple morning science
block with a single Mastcam image of the target “Glendora” along with some
Mastcam and Navcam atmospheric observations. After that, we used the arm to
take close-up images of targets “Ricardo” and “Pelona,” and to brush off
Ricardo in preparation for an overnight measurement of its composition using
APXS. The afternoon science block was dedicated to some more atmospheric
observations.</p>
<p>On sol 807, we did some Navcam cloud monitoring over Mount
Sharp, and made some Mastcam observations of targets “Shoemaker”, Pelona, and
Ricardo. After that, we drove toward “Pink Cliffs” and then took some Mastcam
and Navcam of our surroundings to look for good locations for more contact
science. Our expected downlink for sol 807 was limited, so we had to be careful
about prioritizing which data came down first.</p>
<p>Of course, while sol 807 planning was happening, the Rosetta
team (including several of our colleagues on Curiosity) was busy making history
by landing on a comet! The <a href="http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Missions/Rosetta/(class)/image" target="_blank">pictures </a>that the Philae lander is returning are
just spectacular – congratulations to the European Space Agency!</p>
<p>In Curiosity’s sol 808 plan, we have some more Mastcam and
Navcam atmospheric monitoring and dust-devil searches. There is also a Mastcam mosaic
of “Pink Cliffs” and of targets “Rosamond” and “Fernando.” Then the arm will
get a workout: MAHLI will take a picture of the ChemCam window and the REMS UV
sensor, and then Curiosity will brush the dust off of the target Rosamond,
followed by MAHLI images, and several APXS measurements, including an overnight
integration.</p><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em></div>

<p>MSL planning is no longer restricted, but today's
commands must be sent to the spacecraft earlier than usual, so tactical
planning started 1 hour earlier than usual.&nbsp; The Sol 803 drive put the
rover in a good position for examination of

The science
team proposed several arm activities on various targets, but time
limitations required reducing the observations to APXS measurements and
MAHLI imaging of two targets, "Ricardo" and "Pelona."&nbsp; The Dust Removal
Tool will be used to brush dust off of the target
Pelona before imaging it with MAHLI and placing the APXS on it for
overnight integration.&nbsp; It was a hectic morning for me as SOWG Chair as
we prioritized science targets and determined what could be included in
the plan and reviewed before the deadline for
uplink to the rover.&nbsp; </p><p>

On Sol 801, Mastcam and ChemCam will observe the material disturbed by
the scuff, the "wall" of the scuff, and undisturbed material outside of
the scuffed area for comparison.&nbsp; Then the
APXS will be placed on the disturbed target "Kelso" for overnight
integration. Much more arm work is planned for Sol 802:&nbsp; The APXS will
be used to sense the surface, allowing more accurate placement of MAHLI
near targets "Dumont," "Kelso," and "Garlock" for
high-resolution imaging.&nbsp; Then the APXS will be placed on Dumont for
another overnight integration.&nbsp; Planning all of these activities took
more time than usual, so as SOWG Chair I had to watch the clock and push

of new data on Sols 799 and 800 to allow more of the walkabout data to
be returned.&nbsp; Before the Sol 799 drive and scuff, ChemCam and Mastcam
will observe a bright outcrop named "Hackberry Spring."&nbsp; Then CheMin
will add more mineralogical data for the Confidence

<p>I’ve been swamped with work for other projects recently, but
those are behind me now, and I’m excited to get caught up on what Curiosity has
been doing! The plan for Sol 792 has a nice big science block that we plan to
fill with lots of targeted observations by ChemCam and Mastcam. ChemCam will
analyze the target “Cajon” on the “Carnivore Canyon” outcrop and “Agate Hill”
and “Aztec” targets on the “Alexander Hills” outcrop. ChemCam will also analyze
the target “Crowder” right in front of the rover. Mastcam will take some
supporting images of these targets, plus mosaics of “Zion Canyon”, “Tortoise
Shell Mountain”, and a survey mosaic off the starboard side of the rover. Once
all of the remote sensing is done, we are planning a drive toward the Chinle
outcrop, during which MARDI will take time-lapse video of the terrain beneath
the rover in order to create a continuous image strip along the path. The rover
will also take some routine mid-drive and post-drive images. On Sol 793,
ChemCam will make a passive observation of the sky and Navcam and Mastcam will
also make some atmospheric observations.</p>

<p>The experience I gained planning the MARDI drive
"video" for Sol 780 helped me prepare for another MARDI video during the
Sol 782 drive.&nbsp; I'm MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead again today, and got a good
start on the video and post-drive MAHLI/MARDI
observation planning.&nbsp; But concerns were raised about the safety of Sol
783 ChemCam observations of Comet Siding Spring after the Sol 782
drive, so the drive was deleted from the plan along with the associated
MARDI and MAHLI imaging.&nbsp; While I was disappointed
by this change of plans, I recognized the importance of the comet
observations.&nbsp; Comet Siding Spring will be closer to Mars this weekend
than any comet has approached Earth in historic times, and all the
<a href="/images/NASA_Spacecraft_Observing_Comet_Siding_Spring-br2.jpg" target="_blank">spacecraft at Mars</a> will be observing this rare event.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing the results!</p>

<p>We were originally planning to perform some arm tests on Sol 780 to help
diagnose the fault that occurred last weekend, but it was decided that
they were too risky.&nbsp; So a drive toward a target dubbed "Book Cliffs"
was planned instead.&nbsp;
During the drive, MARDI will acquire images of the surface just behind
the left front wheel to show what the Pahrump Hills rocks look like all
along the rover traverse.&nbsp; As MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead, I was busy today
planning the details of this MARDI "video."&nbsp;
We also planned a MAHLI stowed image at the end of the drive, which is
safe because no arm motions are involved. </p>

<p>The Sol 775 MAHLI activities were planned in advance, so it was an easy

illuminate the entire scene.&nbsp; Then MAHLI will take images of the 5
locations on "Morrison" that will be measured by the APXS.&nbsp; All of the
images will be taken late enough in the day that they should be fully
illuminated by the Sun.&nbsp; On Sol 776, ChemCam and
Mastcam will observe several targets at various distances from the
rover, then CheMin will analyze the drill sample again overnight.&nbsp; The
CheMin analysis requires a fair amount of power, so the rover will
recharge most of the following day.&nbsp; Finally, after
sunset on Sol 777, Mastcam, and ChemCam will observe the bright star

<p>The tactical team took a day off Thursday
to make the transition from restricted (every other day) to nominal
(daily) planning.&nbsp; That meant that, to complete all of the planning for
the weekend in time to send the commands to the rover
by the start of Sol 768 (at 7 PM PDT), planning had to start 1.5 hours earlier than usual (at 6:30 AM PDT).&nbsp;
It's good that we started early, because the weekend plan is full:&nbsp;
After SAM preconditioning during the day, MAHLI will image the
"Confidence Hills"
drill hole after sunset on Sol 768 using its LEDs to illuminate the
hole and tailings.&nbsp; SAM activities typically require lots of power and
are best done during the night, so the rover will recharge during the
day on Sol 769 before performing a 10-hour overnight
SAM evolved gas analysis without sample.&nbsp; This analysis will provide a
good baseline for the upcoming SAM measurements of the drill sample,
currently planned to begin on Sol 771.&nbsp; In preparation for those
measurements, SAM will perform another preconditioning
late on Sol 770, after the rover recharges during the day.&nbsp; </p>

Curiosity continues to investigate the Pahrump Hills outcrop. The Sol 767 plan includes MAHLI and APXS observations of the target Morrison, as well as MAHLI images of the drill hole and dump pile (the dump pile consists of the part of the drilled sample that did not make it through the 150-micron sieve). Today’s plan also includes ChemCam and Mastcam observations of the targets “Paoha,” “The Maze,” and “Quartz Spring,” to characterize the drill tailings and other rock features. There is also an atmospheric observation to look for clouds, along with standard RAD and REMS activities. In addition to the science observations, the Sol 767 plan includes SAM cup conditioning to prepare for upcoming SAM activities. Tomorrow will be a soliday, and then we are looking forward to upcoming SAM and CheMin activities.

Curiosity is currently investigating the Pahrump Hills outcrop. This Navcam image from Sol 762 shows part of the workspace with the arm down, analyzing the Confidence Hills drill tailings. While we wait for CheMin to tell us what minerals are present in the drilled sample, we will spend Sol 766 doing targeted remote sensing. The two-hour science block includes ChemCam observations of the interior wall of the Confidence Hills drill hole, as well as nearby fractures (“Straight Cliffs”) and upcoming MAHLI and APXS targets named “Comb Ridge” and Morrison. There are also several Mastcam observations to document the ChemCam targets and image the nearby sand ripples. The plan also includes a number of atmospheric observations to monitor the opacity and search for clouds and dust devils. On Sol 767 we’re planning to do contact science on the target Morrison, and prepare for possible SAM activities.</p>

reflect off of the structure of the crystals in the sample. To make sure that
every possible orientation of the crystals is measured, the sample holder
vibrates, causing the powdered rock to mix around in the sample cell. </p>
<p>The drill sample has been sieved so that only particles
smaller than 150 microns will go to CheMin. The rover will dump out the particles
that are coarser than 150 microns, take pictures of them with Mastcam and MAHLI,
and measure their composition with APXS. Not all of the fine-grained sample
will go to CheMin: some will be saved for analysis by SAM, and in case we want
to re-analyze it with CheMin.</p><em style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22.0799999237061px;">Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment, communication relays and rover status.</em>

<p>Curiosity has had a busy weekend! We arrived at the location
called Pahrump Hills, which has a nice flat expanse of bedrock for us to drill
and get our first taste of Mt. Sharp rocks. On Sol 755 we took pictures of the
outcrop with MAHLI, brushed it with the Dust Removal Tool (DRT), and measured
its composition with APXS. Then, on Sol 756 <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=0756MH0003970010204575C00_DXXX&amp;s=756" target="_blank">we did a “mini-drill”</a> to test the

will be zapping the targets Mammoth and Morrison, and Mastcam will take images
of those targets, plus the tailings from the mini-drill. Then we will use MAHLI

After a successful 114 m drive through Amargosa Valley on Sol 751, we are planning our arrival at the Pahrump Hills! The scenery is fantastic, and this Navcam image shows the bright outcrop that we intend to investigate. Planning is restricted this week, so today we are planning Sols 753 and 754. On the first sol we are planning several Mastcam and Navcam observations to characterize the terrain and the local geology, as well as a SAM observation to study the composition of the atmosphere. A short ~30 m drive on Sol 753 should put Curiosity in a good position at the Pahrump Hills. Sol 754 will consist of 2 hours of untargeted remote sensing, including ChemCam calibration activities to prepare for the Pahrump investigation, and a Navcam movie to monitor the atmosphere. While Curiosity is busy making her way towards the Pahrump Hills, the MSL Science Team is meeting in Pasadena this week to discuss recent results and plan upcoming science investigations!

Because we expect to encounter the same rock unit on the other side of Pahrump Hills, we decided to drive. But first, Mastcam and ChemCam will examine nearby targets "Shinarump" and "Upheaval Dome," the latter named after an eroded impact structure in southeastern Utah. On Sol 752, ChemCam will shoot "blind" at the surface to the right of the rover, and Mastcam will acquire a 360-degree panorama.</p>

The volume of data sent from MSL to Earth has been less than usual over
the past few days because the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) went
into "safe mode," a software state that ensures ample solar power and
telecommunications.&nbsp; This
has happened several times before on MRO, and another prompt recovery
is in progress.&nbsp; Without MRO data relay, MSL operations depends on
relay through the Mars Odyssey orbiter, which was not expected to be received until
almost 11:00 Friday. Therefore, the
planning schedule was changed to a "rapid traverse" sol, in which science
observations are limited to allow the day's activities to be prepared
and reviewed more quickly. This allowed us to plan a rover drive when
we otherwise would not have been able to when starting at 11 AM Pacific
time.&nbsp; So the Sol 735 plan includes another ChemCam
passive sky observation and a Mastcam panorama of
the <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NLB_462392403EDR_F0402040NCAM00269M_&amp;s=731" target="_blank">sand dunes</a> that the rover drove past on Sol 733. Only REMS atmospheric measurements are planned for Sols 736 and 737.

Today we received all the data needed to plan a nice drive, plus
MastCam and ChemCam observations of a target dubbed "Red Pass" on Sol
733.&nbsp; We are planning 2 sols today to get a head start on the long
weekend plan.&nbsp; On Sol 734, ChemCam will take spectra of
the sky during the day, then SAM will sample the atmosphere overnight.&nbsp;
The goal of these observations is to compare the atmospheric chemistry
measured by the two instruments.&nbsp;

Curiosity is back to driving! We are taking the high road around Hidden Valley to avoid potentially deep ripple fields, and making our way towards a large crater. <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NRB_462215529EDR_F0401850NCAM05114M_&amp;s=729" target="_blank">This image</a> from Sol 729 shows the crater just ahead of us.
The Sol 731 plan includes a drive to the rim of the crater and some ChemCam and Mastcam observations to characterize the local geology. In the pre-drive targeted science block, Curiosity will investigate targets named “Beck Spring,” “Eagle Mountain,” “Furnace Creek,” and “Rainstorm.” After the drive we will acquire our standard post-drive imaging and some systematic observations. Tomorrow is a soliday (a day without planning to allow Earth and Mars schedules to sync back up), so there will be no blog, but the sol 732 blog will be posted the following day.

After much study and discussion, the MSL team decided not to attempt to drill again into <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1697" target="_blank">the rocks in front of the rover</a>. On Sol 728, ChemCam and Mastcam will observe several nearby targets and <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00078/mcam/0078ML0579000000E1_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">the observation tray</a> on the rover. The Sol 729 plan is dominated by the drive, with a single set of MAHLI wheel images. After the drive, on Sol 730, multiple instruments will observe the sky, ChemCam will shoot <em>blind</em> at the surface to the right of the rover, and MARDI will acquire another image during twilight. All of the MAHLI and MARDI activities are pretty standard, so it was an easy planning day for me as MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead.

While we wait for data acquired on Sol 726 to be received later tonight, the Sol 727 plan includes only remote sensing observations. Mastcam and ChemCam will observe both nearby and distant targets during the day, then will attempt to observe some stars after dusk. The goal of the star imaging is to determine how accurately the instruments can be pointed, to support planning for potential observations of comet <a href="/comets/sidingspring/" target="_blank">Siding Spring</a> when it passes very close to Mars in October. An additional benefit, if these stellar observations are successful, is that the data will be useful for checking the radiometric calibration of the cameras.

We were hoping that the Sol 726 plan would include full drilling of the <a href="/images/mars-curiosity-rover-drilling-Sol-722-Mastcam-Color-pia18602-br2.jpg" target="_blank">Bonanza King</a> target, but the downlink from Sol 724 showed that the mini-drill activity did not complete successfully, probably because the rock moved during drilling. Planning is still restricted, so the Sol 725 plan had not yet been sent to the spacecraft when the Sol 724 data were received. After much discussion, we decided to send the Sol 725 plan to the rover, recognizing that some of the ChemCam LIBS observations would be precluded by software because the arm will be in the way. We also decided to retract the drill and take all of the MAHLI and all of the other imaging data of the mini-drill hole that were originally planned for Sol 724 but were not acquired after the drilling was aborted. So it was a busy day for me and the other people scheduled to support MAHLI uplink!

We are still looking forward to data from sol 724’s mini-drill experiment, and since we don’t have
that yet, we can’t do the full drill in the sol 725 plan. So instead, we are doing a remote sensing day
on sol 725, which means lots of Mastcam and ChemCam. ChemCam will be zapping four targets:
the tailings from the mini-drill on “Bonanza King”, plus targets “Carrara,” “Perdido,” and “Lee Flat”.
Mastcam will be taking documentation images of those targets, plus a mosaic of the target “Lone Pine”
and a photometry experiment to measure how sunlight reflects from the martian soil at different
illumination angles. There are also some Mastcam images of the sun to measure the amount of dust in
the atmosphere, and Navcam will be looking for clouds over Mount Sharp. Meanwhile, CheMin will be
getting ready to ingest some of the drilled rock powder by rotating an empty analysis cell into position.
</p>
<p>
While we wait for pictures of our mini-drill results, I highly recommend that you take a look at <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2014/08190630-curiosity-wheel-damage.html" target="_blank">this post</a>

Everything went well over the weekend, and the drill target seems to be nice and stable, so for the Sol
724 plan, Curiosity will do a “mini-drill” into <em>Bonanza King</em>. This activity is complicated enough that
there wasn’t much of a chance to do any science observations other than those that support the drilling,
except for standard DAN and REMS environmental monitoring. The mini-drill activity does basically what
it sounds like: it drills just a little bit into the target. We do this to make sure the rock characteristics are
safe for a full-depth drill hole. One step closer to a 4th full drill hole on Mars!

We’re gearing up for our fourth drill hole on Mars! For the sol 721 plan, we have a long block of time
dedicated thoroughly analyzing the drill target <em>Bonanza King</em>. During this block, we will analyze 25
points on the target with ChemCam in a 5x5 grid, and follow up with Mastcam images of Bonanza King
using multiple different filters (we call images like this that use multiple different filters <em>multispectral</em>
images). Mastcam will also take multispectral images of targets <em>Millers Spring</em> and <em>Smokey</em>, plus a
mosaic of the south wall of Hidden Valley to cover an area that previous mosaics did not.
</p>
<p>
Sol 722 will be dedicated to contact science on the drill target, with MAHLI images and APXS
measurements. The rover will also collect data to make sure that it is in a stable location for drilling,
brush the drill target, and test placing the drill on the target and <em>pre-loading</em> it. <em>Pre-loading</em>
is another term for “pushing” and is necessary for the drill to work: If you have ever done home
improvements and had to drill into wood, you know that you have to push to get the drill bit to bite
into the wood. The same idea applies to Curiosity’s drill, and we do the <em>pre-load</em> test to make sure the
target doesn’t move when the rover pushes on it.
</p>
<p>
After the complicated sol 721 and 722 plans, sol 723 will be a simple sol with just some environmental
monitoring.

Today is a restricted sol, so we are planning a number of untargeted observations. Curiosity should have bumped on Sol 719 to put the condensed drilling target Bonanza King in the work volume, and we are waiting for those data to come down. The Sol 720 plan includes a Mastcam and Navcam photometry experiment to characterize differences in lighting over the same region at different times of day, and a ChemCam blind observation. The plan also includes a couple of ChemCam RMI mosaics to characterize the local geology, and Mastcam imaging to monitor the sand ripples in Hidden Valley. There are also several environmental monitoring activities, including standard REMS and RAD observations, Navcam imaging to look for any clouds related to Mt. Sharp, and Navcam imaging to search for dust devils.

Curiosity is at the northern end of Hidden Valley, and we are preparing for condensed drilling on the target <em>Bonanza King</em>. Condensed drilling means that we will attempt to acquire a drilled sample with high efficiency – including bumping to the target, characterizing the target, drilling and transferring the sample. Bonanza King is part of a light-toned, potentially fine-grained outcrop. When Curiosity drove over Bonzana King on a previous sol, we exposed a fresh rock face. The plan today includes several ChemCam observations to characterize the drill target, a bump to the drill location, and some post-drive imaging to prepare for contact science.

the entrance to Amargosa Valley. Science-wise, the sol 717 plan has ChemCam and Mastcam images of
the target Pogonip, a ChemCam LIBS analysis of a target called Greenwater, and Mastcam stereo of the
Greenwater region. We also have a ChemCam blind observation after the drive, along with other routine

The Sol 713 drive got us out of the sand and onto solid (albeit rocky) ground! For Sol 714, the plan is to
drive the rest of the way out of Hidden Valley to a slight high point in the terrain so that we can take
pictures for route planning. Before the drive on sol 714, there is a ChemCam blind observation and a
Mastcam observation of a target called Harkless. During the drive, there will be a pause for some mid-
drive imaging of the rover’s tracks. And then on sols 715 and 716 the rover will be in <em>planned runout</em>

direction we came from to get out of the sand that has been causing driving difficulties recently. Once
we’re on more stable ground, we will weigh science and engineering considerations and decide what
our driving strategy will be: do we keep trying to drive in the sand in Hidden Valley, or do we drive on
the rocky surface of Zabriskie plateau?

<h2 class="title">Sol 704 Update On Curiosity From USGS Scientist Ken Herkenhoff: Off-Planet Driving Record</h2>
<p class="date">July 29, 2014 - Tuesday</p>
<div class="description">
<p>I should have mentioned yesterday that the Opportunity rover recently broke the <a href="/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20140728a.html" target="_blank">off-planet driving record</a> that was previously held by the 1973 Lunokhod 2 lunar rover. It will be a long time before the 40-km record is broken, even at the rate MSL is moving. But <em>Curiosity</em> made almost 30 meters of progress on Sol 703, ending up in a location with a nice, <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=FRB_459904991EDR_F0391888FHAZ00304M_&amp;s=703" target="_blank">smooth area</a> in front of the rover, well-suited for dumping the sample from CHIMRA. But, as shown in the same Front Hazcam image, the right front wheel is again perched on a rock, so there was a lot of concern about stability during arm activities. This made planning complicated, as we had to prepare contingency activity plans while rover stability was evaluated. Ultimately, the result of the slip risk assessment process was that arm activities were approved, and we plan to dump the sample on Sol 704. As MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead again today, I focused on the plan for MAHLI imaging of the dump location before and after dumping the sample. ChemCam and Mastcam observations of nearby rock targets <em>Thimble</em> and <em>Resting Spring</em> are planned after the APXS is placed on the dump pile</p>

<p>
After the 13-meter drive on Sol 702, MSL is in a better position to see the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00702/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_459820021EDR_F0391666NCAM00255M_.JPG" target="_blank">terrain ahead</a>. But the front wheels are perched on <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00702/opgs/edr/fcam/FRB_459819816EDR_F0391666FHAZ00302M_.JPG" target="_blank">rocks</a>, so it is not safe to deploy the arm. Therefore, I didn't have much to do as MAHLI/MARDI PUL1 today, just the normal post-drive imaging. Because the view ahead is better, a longer drive is planned for Sol 703. We planned pre-drive Mastcam and ChemCam observations of targets <em>Andrews Mountain</em> and <em>Cuzcatlan</em> and after the drive, a Mastcam mosaic of the valley in front of us.

No science uplink was sent to the rover for sol 697 or 698 because the engineers are investigating an issue with the rover's backup computer. The primary computer used in day-to-day operations is healthy, but we are holding off on science operations until we are sure the backup is healthy, just to be safe.

We’re slowly picking our way across the rugged cap-rock of Zabriskie Plateau. Over the weekend we
drove 23.4 m while also managing to use every single instrument on the rover! For the Sol 696 plan we
will be doing two quick APXS integrations on targets Wildrose and Surprise, along with documentation
images. We’ll also be taking a Mastcam multispectral observation of Mahogany Flats and a right-eye
image of the target Jangle. Multispectral observations involve taking pictures of a target with various
filters in front of the camera. This results in a low-resolution spectrum for each pixel in the image, which
can be used to figure out (very approximately) what type of minerals are present, and to pull out detail
that would not be visible with an ordinary red-green-blue image. Once the science is done in the sol 696
plan, we will drive again.

There isn't time today to plan 3 sols of activities before commands for Sol 693 must be sent to the rover, so no activities are being planned for Sol 693. The plan for Sols 694 includes MAHLI and APXS observations of <em>South Park,</em> ChemCam of <em>Johnnie</em> and Mastcam images of both targets. Another drive is then planned for Sol 695, followed by the standard post-drive imaging. The target rocks are part of the resistant unit that caps other rock units in this area.

Today was the last day of the International Mars Conference. After summaries of Mars missions that are being planned for launch in the next few years, five Mars experts led discussion of the scientific results reported during the conference and plans for the future. Everyone agreed that this is a very exciting time, with lots of new data to analyze and more being acquired every day!

Another good day at the International Mars Conference, with back-to-back talks by USGS Astrogeologists: First, Colin Dundas showed <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/8thmars2014/pdf/1343.pdf" target="_blank">evidence</a> in Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HiRISE images for the ongoing formation of gullies, involving seasonal carbon dioxide frost (dry ice) but not necessarily water. Then Hugh Kieffer gave a very unconventional talk about the uniquely Martian <em>geysers&nbsp;</em>in the south polar seasonal cap, taking the audience along with him on an <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/8thmars2014/pdf/1264.pdf" target="_blank">imaginary visit</a> to this bizarre environment. His use of props (including breaking a pencil and other sound effects) engaged the audience and earned him the longest applause of the entire conference. There were many other excellent presentations (including another 100 posters), but I'm especially proud of my USGS colleagues. We are learning so much about Mars, but of course many unanswered questions remain.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, MSL's Sol 691 drive was successful (almost 24 meters), and the Sol 692 plan included ChemCam and Mastcam observations of the target <em>Pyramid Hills</em> before another drive.

Some of the MAHLI images taken during the Sol 687 ChemCam LIBS measurements of <em>Nova</em> captured the <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1669" target="_blank">plasma generated by the laser</a>! The Sol 690 drive completed as planned, totaling nearly 30 meters over relatively rough terrain. Another rapid-traverse sol was planned today, with ChemCam and Mastcam observations of a bright rock dubbed "Limekiln" before the drive. Meanwhile the presentations at the 8th International Mars Conference continued to impress: This morning, the SAM team <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/8thmars2014/pdf/1349.pdf" target="_blank">reported</a> that analyses of the Cumberland drill sample show evidence for organic carbon compounds on Mars, probably <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/8thmars2014/pdf/1201.pdf" target="_blank">benzocarboxylic acids</a>. As exciting as those results are, I was even more interested in the afternoon presentations on the Martian polar deposits, which have long been thought to record global climate changes like Earth's ice ages. As usual, the oral presentations were followed by 2 hours of poster presentations (a fresh set of 100 each day). These poster sessions give all of us a chance to discuss new results in detail and plan future observations and analysis.

Today was another day of fascinating science at the 8th International Conference on Mars! The theme
today was <em>The first billion years</em> and I was struck with the growing number of people suggesting that
Mars was never particularly warm or wet in its past. Bob Haberle gave a nice <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/8thmars2014/pdf/1270.pdf" target="_blank">summary</a> of the challenges
in coming up with a plausible way to get a thick enough atmosphere on early Mars for warm and wet
conditions, concluding that nobody has really figured out a way to do it despite decades of work on
the topic. There was a lot of discussion of the <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/8thmars2014/pdf/1494.pdf" target="_blank">icy highlands hypothesis</a> for the climate of early Mars,
which suggests that ice on Mars should be trapped at high elevations (in much the same way that snow
collects on the peaks of high mountains on Earth) and that rare melting of that ice caused the formation
of the water-related features that are observed on Mars. This is far from the only possibility though, and
the day was <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/8thmars2014/pdf/sess301.pdf" target="_blank">full</a> of <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/8thmars2014/pdf/sess351.pdf" target="_blank">a lot</a> of interesting discussion, trying to bring together the various lines of evidence to
figure out what Mars was like during its first billion years.
</p>
<p>
Curiosity completed a short 9.6 meter drive on sol 689 as expected. For Sol 690 uplink, there was limited
time for science but the team managed to fit a ChemCam observation of the target Reed before the
drive.

Many of the scientists on the MSL team are attending the <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/8thmars2014/" target="_blank">8th International Mars Science Conference</a> this week on the Caltech campus in Pasadena. I was pleased to see that 2 of the first 3 speakers were USGS Astrogeology colleagues: The first speaker, Ken Tanaka, introduced the new global geologic map of Mars that was included in the packet of materials handed out to each registered attendee. Ken led the major mapping effort that culminated in the publication of this <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/8thmars2014/pdf/1087.pdf" target="_blank">map</a>, and received well-deserved applause when he presented it to the audience. The third speaker, Oleg Abramov, showed the <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/8thmars2014/pdf/1484.pdf" target="_blank">results</a> of his detailed modeling of the effects of impact bombardment on the early history of Mars, concluding that the crust of the planet was probably not completely melted, leaving open the possibility of habitable environments during that violent time.
</p>
<p>
With all this going on, I wasn't able to keep up with MSL operations, but my review of the latest project reports shows that the rover drove over 82 meters last weekend. The Sol 689 drive will be more limited because the terrain ahead is rough.

Today we received data from sol 685, showing that we drove 60.4 meters, and the rover is busy doing
its sol 686 activities right now. Today we are planning sols 687 and 688 to cover the weekend (Sunday is
a <em>soliday</em>, which is a day without planning to allow Earth and Mars schedules to sync back up). We’re
trying something special in the sol 687 plan: MAHLI is going to capture a picture of the plasma plume
generated when ChemCam zaps a rock! Because of the low atmospheric pressure on Mars, the spark of
plasma generated when ChemCam’s laser zaps a rock is larger and brighter than it would be on Earth.
This is a complicated activity that has required lots of pre-planning but hopefully it will show a nice
bright spark. After ChemCam zaps the rock (dubbed <em>Nova</em>), and MAHLI catches it in the act, we will
take advantage of the fact that the rover’s arm is already out and place the APXS on the rock to do an
overnight integration. Then, on sol 688, we will do another drive.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, most of the Mars scientists on the team are getting ready to head to the 8th International Conference on Mars next week (it’s actually in Pasadena, California, not on Mars). The rover will be
doing <em>rapid traverse</em> sols next week so the plans will be light on science and focused on driving. Your
blogging team will also be in Pasadena, so we won’t be able to do our daily Curiosity updates here, but
we will try to put up a few brief posts about some of the interesting Mars science at the conference!</p>

<div class="description">
<p>
The sol 683 drive was cut a bit short because the rover yaw exceeded the specified limits for the drive,
which is a fancy way of saying that the rover steered away from its planned route to avoid an obstacle.
The rover drivers tell the rover to stop when a drive deviates too far from the planned direction so
that they can check and make sure everything is ok. The good news is: the rover is healthy and we’re
planning another drive on sol 685. Before we drive, we will do a quick Mastcam observation of the sun
and a ChemCam passive sky observation. After the drive we will do our standard post-drive imaging.
Then, on sol 686 we will do a blind ChemCam observation with an accompanying Mastcam image. (We
can’t drive on sol 686 because we don’t know how the sol 685 drive went).

Today we are planning Sol 685, which includes a short pre-drive science block, 2.5 hours of driving, and some post-drive imaging for targeting. The pre-drive science block contains some environmental monitoring including ChemCam passive spectroscopy of atmospheric composition and a Mastcam measurement of atmospheric dust opacity. Since we are still driving through a lot of loose sand, we expect that the drive will cover a distance of ~60 m. Once we get through this area of ripples we’ll drive up onto the Zabriskie Plateau, named after a sandstone near Shoshone, California. Tomorrow will be another restricted sol as we wait for data to come down, and then we’re looking forward to possible contact science and more driving over the weekend!

On Sol 683 Curiosity drove across a ripple to see how the vehicle performs in the loose sand. Today we are planning Sol 684, which is a restricted sol (meaning we don’t have all of the data down from 683 in order to plan another drive), and it’s also a very constrained sol in terms of available power. So it will be a light sol in terms of science (only some data management activities and standard environmental monitoring), but this way we’ll be able to have more time for science and driving in the Sol 685 plan. So we’ll recharge today and look forward to another long drive tomorrow!

RAD and REMS will continue their environmental monitoring during the runout, but the other science instruments will be off. Curiosity will be ready and waiting to do more driving and science on Monday!

The Sol 677 drive was stopped after almost 20 meters (out of 57 m planned) by the autonomous navigation software, when it detected an obstacle more than 20 cm high. But the rover is healthy and acquired the post-drive data as planned, including Navcam images showing the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00677/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_457591881EDR_F0380338NCAM00282M_.JPG" target="_blank">rover tracks</a> into the ripples where it got stuck, then backed out and around them. The Sol 677 post-drive data did not arrive until almost 14:00 Pacific time, so Sol 678 is being planned on the <em>rapid-traverse</em> timeline. Before the drive, Mastcam images of targets <em>Tin Mountain</em>, <em>Ryan</em>, and <em>Argenta</em> will be acquired.

Last weekend, MSL successfully backed out of the sandy ripple, pausing to <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00674/opgs/edr/fcam/FRB_457336902EDR_F0380006FHAZ00340M_.JPG" target="_blank">image her tracks</a>. So more driving toward <em>Mt. Sharp</em> is planned for this week. Because of the phasing between Earth and Mars time, we are planning <em>rapid-traverse</em> sols, in which the entire uplink process is completed in only 7 hours. The Sol 675 data were not received until almost 13:00 Pacific time, as expected. Therefore, the uplink team had to work later than usual to plan a ChemCam and Mastcam observation of a ripple target named <em>Radcliff,</em> and -- more importantly -- another drive.

<p>
I'm MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead today, planning Sols 673-675 to get MSL through the weekend. It turned out to be a busy day, as the Sol 672 did not complete nominally. A 101-meter drive was planned, but after traversing 82 meters the rover stopped because it determined that it was slipping too much. As the vehicle was crossing some <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00672/opgs/edr/fcam/FLB_457152435EDR_F0380000FHAZ00302M_.JPG" target="_blank">sandy ripples</a>, the wheels encountered soft sand and the rover automatically detected that progress was not being made at the expected rate, and correctly halted the drive. Coincidentally, the rover stopped right on the landing ellipse, a major mission milestone! The vehicle was designed to be able to traverse far enough to drive out of the region defined by the uncertainty in the landing location, and has now achieved that laudable goal.
</p>
<p>
We had been planning to acquire a full set of wheel images on Sol 673, but the current rover location is not suitable for this activity, so we decided to plan contact science instead. MAHLI images of a target <em>Sourdough</em> will be taken before placing the APXS on it and integrating overnight, in parallel with SAM scrubber cleaning. On Sol 674, the rover will drive out of the ripple, then turn around to get a better look at the location it is at now. The plan for the final sol (675) is dominated by cleaning of SAM's getter and trap.

Today we honored the contributions of women on the MSL team, with 75% of the operations roles filled by <a href="/msl/mission/missionteam/women-scientists-engineers-mars/" target="_blank">women</a>! I was on duty as the Geology and Mineralogy Science Theme Lead, and it was an exciting day of planning. Curiosity has just entered the Shoshone quad, and our top priority is driving. The Sol 672 plan includes ChemCam and Mastcam observations to characterize the local geology (with the appropriately named <em>Mountain Girl</em> target), a drive, and some post-drive imaging to prepare for targeting over the weekend. The plan also includes some routine environmental monitoring. Hopefully with the drive on Sol 672 we will reach the edge of the landing ellipse, which will be a major milestone. Thanks to all of the women (and men) who continue to explore Mars!

<p>
After a 107 m drive on sol 670, we are now in Shoshone quad, and just 160 m from the edge of the landing ellipse! The sol 671 plan is a lot like the sol 670 plan, with a 3 hour drive as the main activity. These long drives often use <em>visual odometry,</em> where the rover takes pictures along the way to monitor how the drive is going and avoid obstacles. This is a great capability, allowing us to drive farther than we could otherwise, but a side effect is that it produces a lot of data. The result: less data available for
science observations.
</p><p>
All of which is to say that today was another data-constrained sol. There’s always a way to squeeze some science in though! Today’s plan has a color stereo image of a rock dubbed <em>Lost Burro,</em> a ChemCam passive observation of the sky, and a NavCam movie of the sky looking for clouds. (<em>Passive</em> means that we don’t fire the laser, we just passively collect the spectrum of the target.) We also managed to squeeze a ChemCam measurement of our titanium calibration target and a MAHLI end-of-drive stowed image between the orbiter communication passes. And of course, we always do routine environmental monitoring with RAD, REMS, and DAN. Plus, after each drive we take <em>clast survey</em> images of the ground with Mastcam. Not bad for a data-constrained sol!

After yesterday’s drive of around 39 m, we are just 24 m away from the boundary of the <em>Shoshone</em> quad! The landing site is divided up into squares 1.5 km on a side that we call <em>quads</em>. All of the targets in a given quad are assigned names from assigned names from various geologically interesting sites on Earth. Right now we’re in the <em>Hanover</em> quad, so recent targets have been named after locations in New Hampshire. Before that we were in the <em>Kimberley</em> quad, so target names were locations in the Kimberley region in Australia. Once we enter the Shoshone quad after today’s drive, target names will be based on places near Shoshone, CA near Death Valley.
</p><p>
Planning today was a bit challenging because we were limited on the amount of data we could collect, but after a full Mars year of practice the team is good at working with constraints. The main activity in the plan is a ~3 hour drive block, but before the drive we managed to fit in one ChemCam observation of a rock called <em>Bloods Brook</em> with a Mastcam documentation image to go with it, plus our usual post-
drive images.

Happy new year everyone! As of around 3pm (Mars time) on sol 669, Curiosity will have been exploring Mars for a full martian year (687 Earth days). And what a year it’s been! We’ve <a href="/multimedia/images/?ImageID=6353" target="_blank">driven a long way</a> and done a lot of great science. We’ve measured the age of martian rocks, found <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/news/msl20130530f.html" target="_blank">evidence</a> for flowing water, and even drilled into rocks formed in an <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-092" target="_blank">ancient habitable lakebed</a>.
</p><p>
Just as we wrap up our first Mars year of operations, we’re getting tantalizingly close to the edge of the landing ellipse. Over the weekend, our drive put us in a location with a limited view in front of us, so the plan today is to do a shorter drive to the top of a small ridge to get to a better vantage point. From there, we should be able to see much farther and plan some more long drives. Before we drive in today’s plan, ChemCam will zap two targets: a wind-blown ripple called <em>Holt’s Ledge</em> and a rock called <em>Calef</em>. (Any resemblance between this rock and our Keeper of the Maps, <a href="https://twitter.com/cirquelar" target="_blank">Fred Calef</a>, is purely coincidental.)

On Sol 665, Curiosity completed the longest drive of the mission so far (142.5 m!) through the Moosilauke Basin, and we’re busy planning 3 sols of activities that Curiosity will carry out over the weekend. On the first sol Curiosity will acquire ChemCam observations of a rock target and a soil target, and a 360-degree Mastcam mosaic to assess the local geology. The weekend plan also includes nighttime MAHLI imaging of the CheMin inlet, and full MAHLI wheel imaging. On the third sol Curiosity will complete another drive, and acquire some post-drive imaging to help with selecting targets on Monday (Sol 669). We’re making great progress in terms of driving, and we will soon be leaving the Hanover quad and entering the Shoshone quad!

On Sol 665 Curiosity is planning to drive through Robert Frost Pass into Moosilauke Basin. There is an hour of time for targeted science on Sol 665, which includes several ChemCam and Mastcam observations to characterize the local geology. The plan also includes some systematic DAN and REMS measurements and data management activities. Driving has been the top priority lately, and we are approaching the southern edge of the landing ellipse. Thanks to some motivation from Robert Frost, we have been taking the roads less traveled by (or perhaps less covered in large angular blocks!), and that has made all the difference.

I’m hoping to be able to resume blogging about MSL soon, but it will be difficult to report
very frequently because of continuing personal and professional commitments. Fortunately,
two other members of the MSL science team have volunteered to help with this blog: Ryan
Anderson and Lauren Edgar. Ryan is a USGS post-doctoral fellow and member of the ChemCam
science team, who <a href="http://blogs.agu.org/martianchronicles/" target="_blank">previously blogged</a> about planetary science for the American Geophysical
Union. Lauren recently accepted a USGS research scientist position, and will be moving from
Arizona State University to Flagstaff this fall. Both have been heavily involved in MSL mission
operations and data analysis since the rover landed in 2012, and I’m very pleased that they are
willing to spend some of their time contributing to this blog. You’ll be hearing from them soon.
</p><p>
The top priority for MSL continues to be the traverse toward the base of Aeolis Mons (<em>Mt.
Sharp</em>). Progress has been good since leaving The Kimberley, including a 129-meter drive
on Sol 662. We successfully planned a <em>rapid traverse</em> sol last week, in which scientific
observations are limited in favor of maximizing drive distance on days when only a few hours
are available for planning before commands must be sent to the rover. In this way, we can
make progress on days that would previously have been <em>restricted</em> due to the offset between
Earth and Mars time.

MSL is completing the intensive investigation of The Kimberley, having successfully <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1633" target="_blank">drilled</a>, acquired and dropped samples into CheMin and SAM.

The data returned from Sol 610 showed that the rover is stable, so the weekend plan includes lots of arm activities. On Sol 612, APXS and MAHLI will study the planned drill target before the Dust Removal Tool (DRT) brushes it off. Then MAHLI will image the brushed area before the APXS is placed on it for an overnight integration. On Sol 613, MAHLI will take another <em>selfie</em> of the rover (similar to <a href="/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=5297" target="_blank">this image</a>), then pre-load the arm on the drill target. Sol 614 includes lots of remote sensing observations by ChemCam, Mastcam and Navcam. I wasn't on shift today, but followed along because I'll be SOWG Chair on Monday.

So the science team started planning various observations of the target, including MAHLI and APXS, to document its chemical composition and morphology before drilling. However, there were enough concerns about the rover slipping during arm activities that the MAHLI and APXS observations were removed from the plan. More data, needed to confirm that the rover is stable, are expected this afternoon. Hopefully, analysis of these data will show that it is safe to proceed with contact science.

While the strategic rover planners analyzed the data and began evaluating various candidate drill targets, the tactical team planned lots of ChemCam and Mastcam observations of the candidates. Later in the day, the rover planners and scientists discussed the drill options, and selected a flat outcrop about 4 meters away, shown in the upper right part of this <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00606/mcam/0606MR0025570180400951E01_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">image</a>.

I spent some time with the rover planners laying out MAHLI images of the soil target that was also measured by APXS on Sol 605.

Thursday was the last day of the MSL science team meeting, and the discussion shifted from science results to analysis of wheel wear, both on Mars and on Earth. The engineers at JPL have done a lot of testing in the <em>Mars Yard</em> and compared the results with the many images of the wheels on Mars. Although these images show that wheel wear continues, the damage is accumulating at a lower rate due to the changes in traverse planning that have been implemented in the past few months. Driving over rough terrain appears to be the most significant threat to the wheels, and efforts to recognize and avoid hazardous terrain using data returned by Mars orbiters have allowed safer drive paths to be chosen. It was clear that the engineers are not as concerned about wheel wear as they were last fall, and that they do not feel that wheel wear will limit the lifetime of rover mobility. This conclusion was based in part on tests in the JPL Mars Yard that showed that even very heavily damaged wheels performed well in climbing rocky and sandy slopes.

While most of the MSL science team met at Caltech to discuss recent results and plans for the near future, the tactical team planned a 65-meter drive toward the southeastern side of <em>Mount Remarkable,</em> near the site chosen for the next drilling campaign. The rover will pause in the middle of the drive to image the backup drill site, then acquire all the data needed to select contact science targets and bump to a drill site this weekend.

I'm attending a 3-day meeting of the full MSL science team, so I'm less focused on rover operations than usual this week. After lots of interesting discussion of scientific data and hypotheses today, we did spend some time discussing where to drill and acquire a rock sample. The choices have been narrowed down to two locations on the flank of the hill called <em>Mount Remarkable</em> (at upper left, <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00597/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_450494605EDR_F0310718NCAM00267M_.JPG" target="_blank">here</a>). The scientific advantages of the two sites were discussed, and there were no major differences identified. But getting to one of the sites would involve driving over rough, rocky terrain that might damage the wheels, so that site was not favored.

On April 14th, Mars made its <a href="/allaboutmars/nightsky/mars-close-approach/" target="_blank">closest approach</a> to Earth this year. In addition, by chance, Earth's moon is totally eclipsed on the same night, very close in the sky to similarly red Mars. What a beautiful sight! Mars' proximity to Earth makes radio communications easier in general, but relay of data from MSL through the Mars orbiters to Earth is primarily constrained by the position of the orbiters in the sky over MSL. Communication from Earth to MSL is more affected by the Mars-Earth distance, but despite the close approach there was another problem sending commands to the rover last weekend, and therefore the planned contact science and drive did not occur.

It was a busy day for the tactical uplink team, planning 3 sols to get MSL through the weekend. I was MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead, and focused on MAHLI imaging of the ChemCam window to determine how much dust is on it. We've taken such an <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00511/mhli/0511MH0171000012R0_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank&quot;">image</a> before when the window was in shadow, and wanted to try again with the window illuminated. We also planned MAHLI images of hardware on the remote sensing mast, to see if there are any signs of cable/fiber wear. Lots of ChemCam and Mastcam targeted observations are planned for Sol 598, followed by APXS and MAHLI observations on the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00597/opgs/edr/fcam/FLB_450495010EDR_F0310724FHAZ00302M_.JPG" target="_blank">outcrop</a> in front of the rover. Then the rover will drive about 9 meters toward better outcrops, to get into position for more contact science next week. Finally SAM <em>preconditioning</em> and other activities are planned overnight to prepare for the next sample analysis.

Unfortunately, the set of commands sent to the rover for Sol 596 were not received, so the rover correctly responded by executing the <em>runout</em> sequence that is appended to every day's command bundle. After confirming that the rover is healthy, the tactical team sent an only slightly modified version of the Sol 596 plan to the rover for execution on Sol 597. Hopefully it will be received as usual, and the rover will drive toward the outcrops of interest.

The surface near the rover isn't very interesting, so planning for Sol 596 focused on driving toward the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00595/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_450318229EDR_F0310538NCAM00265M_.JPG" target="_blank">outcrops</a> up to 50 meters away.

Mars is at <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1618" target="_blank&quot;">opposition</a> today, so Mars will rise at sunset and be visible all night here on Earth. On Mars, Earth is not visible because it is too close to the Sun.

<p>
The MSL Sol 595 plan is dominated by a drive along the edge of The Kimberley outcrop with Mastcam and Navcam stereo imaging at 4 locations along the way. Lots more Mastcam images will be taken after the drive, to help plan our exploration of The Kimberley. It was an easy day for me as MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead, as only standard MAHLI wheel images, a stowed image, and a MARDI twilight image were planned.

So a longer drive (about 45 m) is planned for Sol 588, around the rocky outcrop and then south. But first, a large stereo Mastcam mosaic of the outcrop will be acquired, plus smaller mosaics of targets <em>Point Coulomb</em>, <em>Brooking Gorge</em>, and <em>Castlereagh Hill</em>. After the usual post-drive imaging and DAN active measurement of subsurface hydrogen, ChemCam will zap the ground to the right of the rover and Mastcam will acquire a mosaic of the hill to the west of the expected rover location. This final mosaic will be pointed assuming the drive completes as planned.

Planning is no longer restricted now that the local time in Gale Crater and Pacific time are more in synch. So drive progress toward <em>The Kimberley</em>&nbsp;is expected to be more rapid this week. I'm SOWG Chair again today, and planning is going relatively smoothly so far despite the fact that we added a ~20-meter drive after a full set of wheel images. It looked for a while like we would not be able to do any targeted remote sensing before the wheel imaging due to power constraints, but once again the engineering team did a great job and found a way to fit the desired Mastcam observations into the plan.

MSL planning will transition from <em>restricted</em> to <em>nominal</em> next week, so the weekend plan includes only 2 sols, 585 and 586. The first sol is dominated by contact science, mostly MAHLI imaging of areas of the outcrop that have not yet been observed by MAHLI. Targeted remote science is planned on both sols, with APXS and CheMin activities overnight. As SOWG Chair today, I was very busy working to squeeze all of these good observations into the plan. We couldn't fit everything we wanted, but very close! On Sol 586, the rover will bump back from the outcrop in preparation for another full set of MAHLI wheel images. MAHLI has been very busy the past few days, and not done yet!

There was a minor problem with the Sol 576 imaging of CHIMRA that prevented the rest of that sol's plan from completing, and concerns about the safety of the remote sensing mast prevented uplink of the Sol 577 commands. So the rover did very little on Sol 577, but the tactical planning team on Earth had to scramble to recover the uncompleted activities in the weekend plan. After considering several possibilities, Sol 578 was dedicated to recovering all of the CHIMRA imaging and more that was originally planned to be done later. There was time to get some ChemCam observations before a bump to the outcrop on Sol 579, and Sol 580 was dominated by the large Mastcam mosaic of the outcrop that was originally planned for Sol 577.

<p>
After I finished my SOWG Chair shifts last week, I took some time off to celebrate my son's birthday. While I was away, the MSL planning schedule transitioned into "late slide sols" because data from the rover arrive late in the day Pacific time. In order to preserve the ability to send commands to the rover every day, only driving was allowed on these slide sols. This allowed continued traverse progress over the weekend, but very few science observations. Unfortunately, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) suffered an anomaly Sunday <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-078">(news release 2014-078)</a> that interrupted the relay of data from MSL to Earth. Therefore, the drive planned for Sol 567 was cancelled and targeted ChemCam and Mastcam observations of nearby rocks were planned instead. MSL data are typically also relayed by the Mars Odyssey orbiter, so rover operations can continue while MRO is recovering, but with more limited downlink volume.

At the beginning of tactical operations this morning, the plan for Sol 561 was to take a set of MAHLI wheel images. But the nearby terrain was not ideal for wheel imaging, and a safe path ahead was visible, so we decided to drive toward the west again. This didn't leave much power for other activities, but we were able to squeeze in a few, including a CheMin vibration activity in preparation for the next sample ingestion/analysis.

It's been a while since I traveled to JPL to serve as SOWG Chair for MSL planning, so I decided to spend a few days in Pasadena this week. I'm glad I did, because it would have been much more difficult to get the job done this morning from Flagstaff. Several options were "on the table" including contact science, a full set of MAHLI wheel images, targeted remote sensing, and a couple of drive direction choices. So the science team had to prepare contingency plans for these varied scenarios and react to updates from the engineering team regarding the risk of the rover slipping in response to arm motions and potential drive hazards. Once the rover state and nearby terrain were evaluated, we settled on contact science followed by a drive toward the west, and the rest of the planning day went very smoothly. The Sol 560 plan includes APXS and MAHLI observations of a rock dubbed "Secure" followed by a ~27-meter drive.

I have been traveling this week to a meeting of the HiRISE (the big camera that has been taking <a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_034572_1755" target="_blank">images</a> of rovers from orbit, science team, so am catching up with what MSL has been up to. Drive progress has been good, requiring some discipline on the part of the MSL science team to resist diverting the rover toward <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1607" target="_blank">interesting outcrops</a>. In addition, the SAM instrument has been doing overnight combustion experiments that require lots of power. The last one of these is planned early in the morning of Sol 558, so there are no daytime activities planned for Sol 557. Later on Sol 558, Mastcam and ChemCam observations of a target dubbed "Mount Amy" are planned, followed by MAHLI and APXS observations of a soil target named "Johnny Cake." The rover will then drive about 60 meters on Sol 559 and take the standard post-drive images to prepare for possible contact science on Sol 560.

The rover drove over 100 meters on Sol 548, so it is time for another full set of wheel images to monitor wear. Because the MAHLI wheel imaging sequences have been used many times before, it was a relatively easy day for me as MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead. After the wheel imaging is finished, the rover will drive about 6 meters to a <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00548/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_446146685EDR_F0270968NCAM00271M_.JPG" target="_blank">low outcrop</a> and take lots of post-drive images to allow planning contact science on Sol 550.

Another busy 2-sol plan--Sol 544 will begin with a bunch of MAHLI activities: Imaging of the inlet for SAM's tunable laser spectrometer, the standard wheel imaging, and images from various angles of a spot in front of the rover to measure the photometric behavior of the surface. The first and last activities have been desired since early in the mission, so it's good to finally plan them. After stowing the arm, Mastcam and ChemCam will observe targets "Sandy Dam" and "Nita." Before sunrise on Sol 545, ChemCam will search for condensed water. Then the rover will drive about 50 meters and take the post-drive images needed to plan a full set of wheel images on Sol 546.

I'm SOWG Chair again for another 2-sol plan, and it's been a more hectic planning day. The Sol 540 drive went well, about 71 meters total. A shorter (~23 m) drive is planned for Sol 542, allowing some time for pre-drive targeted Mastcam stereo imaging and MAHLI images of the wheels. Because the volume of data expected to arrive in time for planning on Friday is limited, it was a challenge to prioritize all of the necessary data. Another challenge was including a Mastcam search for frost at sunrise on Sol 543 without depleting the battery too much. In the end, we got everything to fit, plus a bunch of untargeted ChemCam and Mastcam observations later on Sol 543.

In order to learn more about the sand dune in <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00527/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_444283159EDR_F0260000NCAM00251M_.JPG" target="_blank">Dingo Gap</a>, the rover will be commanded to drive up to it on Sol 528. Mobility tests on terrestrial sand dunes show that MSL can climb dunes, but we don't yet know that the feature in front of MSL is sandy throughout. Opportunity got stuck in <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mer/images.cfm?id=1699" target="_blank">Purgatory Dune</a> for a few weeks, in part because it contained more fine grained dust than typical terrestrial dunes. So MSL will study the interior structure of the Martian dune before driving over it. There is also a concern that Dingo Gap is deep enough that radio communications directly to/from Earth via the high gain antenna may be affected, so post-drive images looking over the dune into the gap are planned to better assess the terrain.

<p>I'm SOWG Chair again today, planning Sol 513, which will be dominated by a full set of MAHLI images of wheels. The images will be taken between short drives, to turn the wheels a bit and allow the entire surfaces of the wheels to be imaged. This will require a fair amount of power, so the main constraint on science planning was ensuring that we don't take too much charge out of the battery. But we were still able to add some post-drive science, including a DAN active measurement of hydrogen below the surface, a Navcam cloud search, and the usual imaging needed to plan targeted observations on Sol 514. The command sequences must be sent to the rover by about 5 PM Pacific time, so planning started 1.5 hours earlier than usual--not as early as yesterday though, when it was still dark when I drove in to work.

The weekend activities executed as planned, and the rover is in a good location to start a full campaign of wheel imaging. Originally, a short drive or "bump" was planned for Sol 512 to get the rover in position for wheel imaging. Because this bump was not needed, more time was available for contact science. This meant the Science Theme Groups and I (as SOWG Chair) had a hectic morning, preparing for both contingencies as the rover planners evaluated the data to determine whether the bump was needed. We ended up adding an additional APXS/MAHLI target for contact science, including an overnight APXS integration on "Kodak." Planning is unrestricted this week, and due to the timing of the uplink we had to start earlier than usual, at 6:00 Pacific time this morning.

First, MAHLI images and APXS data will be acquired on a rock named "Oneida" in front of the rover. Then the rover will drive about 26 meters and take the usual post-drive images to allow planning the next drive and new scientific activities. Images of the wheels will be taken both during and after the drive.

<p>The drive planned for last weekend went well, so another drive is planned for Sol 472, along with targeted remote science and MAHLI imaging of the rover wheels. Such images of the wheels are now planned more frequently, to assess possible changes in the tears in the wheels. While the arm is deployed, contact science is also planned for Sol 472. Planning is still restricted, so we won't be able to drive again until Sol 474, and untargeted remote science is planned for Sol 473. I'm MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead for Sol 473 planning, with not much to do because the normal post-drive MAHLI and MARDI images are already planned for Sol 472.</p>

There was some concern about tears in the <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00463/mhli/0463MH0262000000E1_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">rover wheels</a>, but today we got the go-ahead to drive, with no restrictions on distance or drive mode. The tears in the wheels were expected based on testing, and the wheels are designed to survive such damage without affecting mobility. We are planning 3 sols today to get the rover through the weekend, so it has been a busy day for me as SOWG Chair. On the first sol, MAHLI imaging of the wheels (to monitor the tearing) will be followed by targeted ChemCam and Mastcam observations. The plan for the second sol is dominated by a long drive, including AutoNav. Then we are planning some untargeted remote science on the third sol.

<p>MSL launched from Florida two years ago today--I was pretty nervous that day, but the mission has obviously gone extremely well! Planning is restricted this week (results of the drive planned for Sol 465 will not arrive until tonight), so we are planning 3 sols of untargeted remote sensing to get the rover through the Thanksgiving holiday. We crammed a lot of science into the 3-sol plan, including a SAM atmospheric measurement, another CheMin analysis of the drill sample, and several ChemCam and Mastcam observations of the sky and distant targets. We also took this opportunity to perform some instrument maintenance activities. So far, planning is going very smoothly!</p>

I'm SOWG Chair again today, planning Sol 465, which includes the first drive since the electrical issue over a week ago. The change in power bus voltage appears to have been caused by an electrical short in the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG), the nuclear power source for the rover. This type of intermittent short has been seen in similar RTGs, including the one on the Cassini spacecraft, which has been orbiting Saturn for years. The rover electronics are designed to operate at variable power supply voltages, so this is not a major problem. In fact, the voltage returned to the normal level late last week, so we are ready to drive again. After some targeted ChemCam and Mastcam observations, a 64-meter drive is planned.

MSL science planning has resumed! Today we are planning 3 sols, with the focus on dropping more of the drill sample into 4 of SAM's cups, for future analysis. While the arm is out, we'll take MAHLI images of the rover wheels and a Mastcam image of the sample seive, for engineering assessment. These arm activities will take 2 sols to complete, so the plan is pretty full. I'm scheduled to support ChemCam planning in the Science Theme Groups today, but because the plan is already so complex we couldn't add any ChemCam observations. Still, it's good be planning science activities again!

I was scheduled as MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead today, but there was nothing to do because all science planning is on hold while the power issue is being investigated.

If the diagnostics go well, we may be able to plan scientific observations as early as Thursday, for Sol 461.

The plan for last weekend included driving on 2 sols. Unfortunately, the first drive, on Sol 455, was aborted due to a wheel stall. There was also an electrical problem, so the Sol 458 plan will be devoted to getting the engineering data needed to recover from this problem. The rover is in a stable configuration but no science activities will be planned until tomorrow.

I was happy to see the <a target="_blank">announcement</a> that features on Mars have been named in honor of Bruce Murray, former JPL director and my thesis adviser at Caltech in the 1980s.

I was SOWG Chair again planning Sol 452, which was disappointing because it was basically a repeat of Sol 451. When the Sol 451 plan was run on the testbed, a potential problem was discovered and the decision was made at the last minute not to send it to the rover. The problem, which may have caused the rover to reboot, was corrected in the Sol 452 plan. The recovery from the software anomaly has been completed and the Sol 453 plan included targeted remote sensing and a drive. The drive went well (~47 meters) and another drive is being planned for Sol 454.

Planning started at 6:30 this morning to allow enough time to plan 3 sols before we have to send the command sequences to the rover by 19:00 this evening. The science theme groups requested lots of good observations, expecting that they wouldn't all fit into the plan. It was therefore a hectic day, but all of the science observations made it into the plan! After taking lots of ChemCam and Mastcam data, the arm will be deployed to acquire MAHLI images and elemental chemical data using APXS. On the last sol, the arm will be stowed in preparation for an upgrade of flight software that will take all next week.

Last weekend's 3-sol plan included back-to-back drives on Sols 436 and 437. This is the first time in the mission that this has been attempted. There was no tactical planning on Monday to allow Mars and Earth time to synch up, but the rover drivers reviewed the available data before giving their <em>go</em> for the second drive. There was applause during the SOWG meeting when the rover drivers announced that both drives had completed successfully!
</p><p>
This morning, planning started at 6:00 PDT, earlier than usual to give us enough time to complete planning before the commands must be sent to the rover this afternoon. So we are sort of back on <em>Mars time</em> today, which is exciting enough that I had no trouble getting up before dawn. I'm MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead today, planning the usual images after another drive toward the second waypoint, called <em>Cooperstown.</em>

MSL planning is still restricted, so we won't get confirmation of the drive planned for Sol 431 in time for planning Sol 432, which is therefore an <em>untargeted-remote-sensing</em> sol. The 432 plan also includes an overnight test of CheMin's ability to analyze sample while communicating with the MRO and Odyssey orbiters. I'm MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead today, with no activities to plan because the normal end-of-drive MAHLI and MARDI observations were included in the Sol 431 plan. But it's fun to be involved in tactical planning anyway, and I'll be helping to plan Sol 433 observations before I take off on vacation for the rest of this week.

Because the terrain the rover has been traversing is a bit rougher, progress has been somewhat slower during the past few sols. We will probably arrive at the second <em>waypoint</em> along the long traverse to Mt. Sharp next week, even if the pace continues to be slower than normal.

I forgot to mention previously that, unlike at other NASA Centers, JPL employees work for Caltech, not NASA directly. So they were not as immediately affected by the government shutdown as NASA and USGS employees. Therefore, because many of the people responsible for operating the rovers are at JPL, tactical operations could continue during the shutdown. So progress has been good, and the plan for this weekend includes another SAM measurement and a drive, among other observations. Again, the activities planned for this weekend are primarily constrained by power, but MSL can still do a lot as temperatures drop during the Martian (southern) autumn.

I apologize for the gap in these updates— the USGS web servers were turned off during the government shutdown. Thanks to support from the MSL Project Scientist and my supervisor, I was permitted to support MSL tactical operations during the shutdown. Unfortunately, I was not allowed to attend the MSL science team meeting Oct. 1-3, but at least I could keep up with rover operations. I was MAHLI/MARDI PUL on October 8th and 10th, and SOWG Chair Oct. 14-15. The priority continues to be on driving, and we are a few drive sols away from the next <em>waypoint</em>. The team has agreed to make the stop for contact science at the next waypoint very brief, minimizing the delay in progress toward Aeolis Mons (Mt. Sharp), the ultimate goal of the mission. As winter approaches in Gale Crater, the lower temperatures mean that more heating, and therefore power, is needed for rover activities. This in turn constrains the time available for scientific observations and driving, so recent plans generally contain fewer activities that they did a few weeks ago. Still, it's good to be back at work full time, helping MSL and other missions achieve their goals.

The autonomous navigation software could not find a safe path toward the rover's goal on Sol 404, so ended up in a configuration that prevented uplink of the Sol 405 command sequences directly to the high-gain antenna from Earth. Without new instructions, the rover executed the <em>runout</em> sequences that are loaded with every set of commands, just in case the new sequences are not received. This was only the sixth execution of <em>autonav</em> during a drive, so the software parameters were set conservatively, preventing the rover from trying to back up and drive around the rocks that it considered hazardous. As more experience is gained in driving with autonav, the rover will be allowed to get itself out of such tight spots. For now, the rover is safe and the Sol 406 plan includes another drive with autonav.

This type of photometric campaign has helped us understand the properties and structure of the surface of Mars on previous missions, and we hope that new data will continue to inform us.

Autonomous navigation continues to work well, allowing longer drives into areas not visible from the previous rover location. Today the view ahead is good enough that we are planning to drive over 100 meters, with the last ~45 meters using AutoNav. But driving this far leaves very little time for targeted science observations, only a few minutes today. We knew that we would have to consider this trade off between observations and drive distance once AutoNav was verified on the B computer, but the decision is still painful. Some scientists want to spend more time studying interesting features during the long traverse to Aeolis Mons ("Mt. Sharp"), but Gale crater was selected as the MSL landing site so that the geologic history recorded in the layers of Aeolis Mons could be investigated. The overall science goal is to get to the base of the mountain with minimal delays.

<p>The Sol 379 drive went well, and the rover is in a safe configuration for arm deployment. So we are planning 3 sols today (to get the rover through the Labor Day holiday), including drop-off of sample to SAM and overnight analysis, followed by a drive on the last sol. We packed some more observations into the plan, including ChemCam, DAN, and Mastcam, along with the usual post-drive imaging to set us up for the next drive. So it has been a busy day, but not as hectic as yesterday.</p>

Autonomous navigation continues to work well, and Curiosity completed another long drive on Sol 378. However, the left rear wheel ended up on a ~6 cm rock, which is larger than allowed for safe deployment of the arm. The concern that the wheel might slip off the rock while the arm is moving around, perhaps damaging the arm, caused a change in plans. The original plan was to use the arm to drop more of the Cumberland drill sample into SAM for another evolved gas analysis (2 sols worth of activities). Instead, we decided to drive about 15 meters to an area with fewer large rocks and try again. So it was a hectic day for me as SOWG Chair, but we recovered nicely from the situation. If the drive goes well, we will have a better view of the path ahead. We are planning 2 sols today, then 3 sols tomorrow to get us through the Labor Day holiday weekend.

The Sol 374 drive, including the AutoNav portion, went very well, so an even longer drive is planned for Sol 376. For the first time AutoNav will be used to drive 10 meters <em>over the hill,</em> or beyond the area imaged in stereo by the Navcams after the Sol 374 drive. If the AutoNav software continues to perform well, allowing the rover to drive into areas that cannot be evaluated in advance, longer AutoNav drives will be allowed.

The autonomous navigation checkout, part of the Sol 372 drive, went perfectly! So "AutoNav" can be used for up to 90 minutes next time. If the software continues to work well, it will be used to drive into areas that cannot be seen from the rover (over hills, for example). The weekend plan includes lots of activities, including MAHLI and APXS observations of targets right in front of the rover on Sol 373, another long drive on Sol 374, and untargeted remote sensing on Sol 375. ChemCam RMI images of the sky, to check the "flat field" calibration of the camera, are also included.

The Sol 371 drive set a new MSL distance record for a single sol, 110 meters. The Sol 372 drive will be shorter, but includes the first test of autonomous navigation ("AutoNav") on the "B" computer. After the Sol 200 anomaly, when the rover swapped to the B computer, problems with the terrain meshes generated using the B Navcams were noted and additional camera calibration data acquired. These data have been analyzed and show that the pointing of the B Navcams (mounted below the A Navcams) varies slightly with temperature. The results have been modeled and used to update the flight software. Accounting for the thermal dependence of the B Navcam pointing has been particularly complex for the AutoNav software, which is now ready for flight testing. The Sol 372 AutoNav checkout is complicated by the desire to set up the rover for potential arm contact science observations this weekend.

So we're planning as many observations as we can squeeze in before the next drive. Because we can see farther ahead of us than usual, the rover planners are planning to drive 100 meters or more. To allow this longer drive, some of the pre-drive science observations had to be deleted. In addition, we don't have time for the post-drive MAHLI stowed image. While removing these observations is frustrating, we all agree that driving has top priority.

I'm SOWG Chair again, planning three sols to get the rover through the weekend. This typically means a long Friday shift, and today is no exception. The 3-sol plan is complex, with lots of science observations and a 100-meter drive. The use of visual odometry (VO) was approved, so this capability is being used to ensure that the rover stays on path and avoids hazards. VO allows the rover to measure its progress by taking images of the terrain during the drive. In addition, the rover is currently on a relative topographic high, so visibility of the terrain ahead is <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00338/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_427502017EDR_F0080610NCAM05114M_.JPG" target="_blank">better than usual</a>.

The current plans include pre-drive targeted remote sensing, DAN neutron spectroscopy at multiple locations during the drive, and as much post-drive imaging as we can fit into the available downlink volume. The checkout of advanced (autonomous) driving software is going well, and we hope to be able to use it soon to extend the drive distance.

The first few drives toward Mt. Sharp have been limited in length because some of the mobility software has not yet been checked out on the B computer. There are separate Hazcam and Navcam stereo pairs connected to each side of the computer, and the B Navcams behave a bit differently than the A Navcams. The camera pointing changes slightly with temperature, and had to be measured by taking images at various times of day. An improved model for the B Navcams has been loaded onto the rover, so now the software can be tested. Similar tests were required on the A computer early in the mission. In the meantime, drives have been limited to about 40 meters or less, depending on how much terrain is visible in the Navcam images from each location.

I'm MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead today, planning Sol 329, which includes another drive toward Aeolis Mons ("Mt. Sharp"). We are planning MAHLI and MARDI images after the drive, to document the terrain in the new location. On Sol 318, we took MARDI <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?s=318&amp;camera=MARDI" target="_blank">images</a> at various times of day to determine when to best acquire such images. The images show that images taken in twilight (right after sunset) best show details of the terrain next to the left front wheel. Because dust was deposited on MARDI's lens during landing, the contrast in MARDI images is reduced. During twilight, less light is scattered off the dusty optics.
</p>
MAHLI images of the view to the left of the rover can be acquired while the arm is stowed, by simply opening the MAHLI dust cover, taking an image, then closing the dust cover. These images include the horizon as well as terrain closer to the rover, so should be useful in documenting changes as we drive along.

MSL continues to study the "Shaler" outcrop, slowed a bit by minor driving problems. Last week, the tilt of the rover exceeded the 12-degree limit during a drive toward the center of the outcrop, so the drive had to be commanded again. That drive was successful except that it ended with the left middle wheel about 20 cm higher than expected on a rock. This situation is not dangerous, but concerns about slipping off the rock while using the arm have precluded use of the arm at this location. Fortunately, it is still possible to acquire remote sensing data, including lots of Mastcam stereo observations and ChemCam measurements.</p>

The approach to Point Lake on Sol 302 went well, allowing the arm to reach the outcrop of interest. However, the rover is tilted over 9 degrees, so we have to wait a sol to confirm that it is stable before planning contact science. Therefore, we could place MAHLI no closer than 10 cm from the outcrop, but such images will still be very useful. So we planned a MAHLI mosaic and individual images of various targets on Point Lake, and hope to receive most of them in time for Sol 304 planning. We can then use them to select targets for higher-resolution MAHLI images and APXS measurements, assuming the rover has not slipped. We also planned a Mastcam mosaic and ChemCam observations of the outcrop.

<p>
I'm SOWG Chair again today, planning Sol 302. The Sol 301 drive went well, and we received images after the drive was complete showing the Point Lake outcrop. Unfortunately, they showed that the slopes near the most interesting part of the outcrop are large enough that we would have to spend an additional sol checking to be sure that the rover did not slip in that location before deploying the arm. The science team discussed the options and decided that the major goals of the Point Lake campaign could be achieved at a different part of the outcrop, where the rover could approach on more level ground. So the Sol 302 plan includes a short drive to this location, along with lots of imaging before and after the drive. If all goes well, we will be able to deploy the arm on Sol 303 and take close-up images with MAHLI and measure the rock's chemistry with APXS. ChemCam observations will help us decide where to target the arm work.

<p>I'm not on shift in any tactical operations roles, but have been helping finish up important observations in the "Cumberland" area before we drive away next week. In particular, I have been leading the effort to take MAHLI images of the drill hole walls at night, using the LEDs to illuminate the hole. We are hoping, based on previous nighttime MAHLI images, that this will provide better views of the walls of the drill hole. This activity is currently included in the 3-sol plan that will get the rover through the weekend.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was Geology/Mineralogy Science Theme Lead for the first time in months, so I was a bit rusty. We tried to fit some MAHLI imaging into the plan, along with overnight CheMin analysis of the Cumberland drill sample, but didn't have enough power. However, we were able to plan a high-priority ChemCam observation of the drill tailings during the day (when warm) and early the next morning (when cold), to look for changes in hydrogen due to daily absorption/desorption of water vapor. The early morning ChemCam observation required pointing the instrument at the target the previous evening, to avoid having to heat and move the remote sensing mast at night.</p>

<p>Because the critical data from yesterday's plan won't be received until around noon Pacific time, MSL tactical planning starts later than usual today. Even though the MSL project made the transition to "Earth time" planning months ago, the schedule is still allowed to shift a few hours when necessary. Meanwhile, Opportunity, on the other side of Mars, sent data in the middle of the night and will receive commands in the afternoon Pacific time. So Opportunity planning is starting earlier than usual (7 AM PDT yesterday). I'm MAHLI uplink lead for MSL again today, but wanted to call in to the Opportunity kickoff meeting this morning to hear the latest. I was rewarded with the news that Opportunity now holds second place among extraterrestrial rovers for total distance traversed, just passing the Apollo 17 lunar rover's record of 35.74 km. First place is still held by the Russian Lunokhod 2 rover, which drove 37 km on the lunar surface. It may be a long work day for me, but operating 2 rovers on Mars is, as they say, "a nice problem to have."</p>

In fact, planning Sol 270 yesterday was more hectic, in part because of the variety of activities we squeezed into the plan, including hundreds of MAHLI images and lots of arm motion. There were a number of high-priority science observations we wanted to accomplish before driving away from the first drill hole, and lots of pressure to fit them into the Sol 270 plan so that we can move on to the next drill target, called <a href="/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=5270" target="blank">Cumberland</a>. The Sol 272 plan includes a bump (short drive) designed to move the rover within 1 meter of "Cumberland" and all the imaging needed to plan another bump that will position the rover for drilling.</p>

<p>I'm not scheduled in any tactical operations roles this week, but have
been calling into planning meetings for both MSL (Curiosity) and MER
(Opportunity). The rovers and other Mars spacecraft are preparing for
the upcoming "superior conjunction" of Mars, when the planet will pass
behind the Sun as seen from Earth. For a couple weeks around
conjunction, it is difficult (or impossible) to communicate with the
spacecraft because radio waves are disrupted by plasma in the Sun's
atmosphere. So command sequences have been prepared to get the
spacecraft through this period safely, without much activity. This
week is our last chance to plan additional observations before the
conjunction plan kicks in, so we are finishing up the highest-priority
science activities on both rovers. On MSL, these include APXS,
Mastcam and ChemCam measurements of the first drill sample after it
was dumped out of CHIMRA. For MER, we have selected in interested
rock target to place the APXS, in order to acquire lots of good data
during conjunction.</p>

I'm SOWG Chair again today, but because anomaly recovery continues we are not planning science activities. So I was able to watch the MSL press conference at NASA Headquarters this morning, during which the discovery of clay minerals and possible organic material in the first drill sample was <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1438" target="_blank">announced</a>. The mineralogy and chemistry of the sample indicates that the environment was more habitable than in other locations on Mars. The water was less acidic than the fluids that formed the sulfate-rich rocks analyzed by the MER rovers, and therefore more conducive to any organisms that may have been there. As pointed out during the press briefing, MSL was never intended to detect life, but has achieved one of the main goals of the mission, to determine whether the ancient environment could have supported life. Because the organic material found by SAM could have been brought from Earth, another drill sample should be acquired and processed to confirm that it is Martian. The first drilling and sample handling should have removed most of whatever terrestrial contamination remains on the drill and other hardware, so future samples should not be contaminated. Of course, the MSL team is very excited about these new results!

As the MSL engineering team continues to study the Sol 200 anomaly, tactical science planning has been cancelled through this weekend. The rover has two computers, and has been running on the A side until yesterday, when commands were sent to boot up the B side. The rover is safe in this configuration, and if necessary we could continue to operate the rover on the B side. But the focus now is on understanding the anomaly and how to recover from it.

Planning was more difficult today because of power limitations. The top priority for Sol 196 is to drop some of the drill sample into SAM and analyze it overnight. SAM is the largest instrument on MSL, and it requires lots of power to run. As usual, the tactical science team proposed some additional observations, but it quickly became apparent that they would not fit into the plan. Even after making the difficult decision to remove them during the SOWG meeting, we still didn't have enough power. Fortunately, we got an updated power prediction late in the meeting that was more favorable--based on analysis of the latest telemetry from the rover, it became clear that the initial estimate of the battery charge at the beginning of Sol 196 was too low. The change in the power prediction allowed us to keep all of the SAM activities in the plan!

There wasn't much room to add additional science observations to the plan, but we were able to squeeze in a couple of ChemCam LIBS activities. We can't wait to see what Chemin will tell us about the minerals in the drill sample!

<p>The "mini-drill" test <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1422" target="_blank">went well</a>, so Sol 182 planning focused on the first full drilling activity. As MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead again, I concentrated on planning MAHLI images of the drill target, to be taken both before and after the drilling. A lot of effort had already gone into planning these images, so I spent most of my time helping to ensure that the planned durations of these imaging activities were correct and would fit into the available time. We also had to tweak the downlink priority of some of the images to ensure that the data needed to assess the results of the drilling will be received in time to plan the next sol.</p>

Planning is still "restricted," so we had an opportunity to acquire more ChemCam and imaging data on Sol 181 while waiting for confirmation that the Sol 180 "mini-drill" <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1421" target="_blank">test</a> completed successfully. As MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead, I focused on planning MAHLI images of 3 targets in front of the rover. We had to avoid the area of the drill testing, to avoid disturbing it, but there are plenty of other areas of interest. Again, the planning assumes that the Sol 181 activities went well, because we won't receive the Sol 181 data until early tomorrow morning.

<p>
Because the "drill-on-rock checkout" <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1419" target="_blank">activity</a> did not complete successfully on Sol 174, the MSL team had to work extra hard to determine how best to recover from the anomaly. Several engineers worked overnight in the rover testbed at JPL to understand the root cause of the problem in time to allow the tactical planning team to repeat the drill checkout on Sol 176 with only a minor change. Because this repeat affects what was tentatively planned for the next few sols, we had to quickly revise the long-term plan and consider how much power is needed in future sols before finalizing the Sol 176 plan. So it was a hectic day as SOWG Chair, but we were all glad the recovery was so quick.

<p>
As SOWG Chair again, I worked hard today to fit as many observations into the Sol 175 plan as possible while leaving enough energy in the batteries for Sol 176 activities. Overnight SAM analysis of a blank cell in preparation for a drill sample takes a lot of power, but we were still able to plan lots of additional MAHLI imaging during the day. We had almost finished reviewing and polishing the sequences when the latest data from the rover were received, including some bad news: there was an anomaly during the arm activities on Sol 174. It was too late in the day to make the major changes in the Sol 175 plan needed to respond to this anomaly, so we had to quit work on the Sol 175 plan and let the rover execute the "runout" plan that is routinely included in every day's set of commands. The runout consists of a few simple, safe activities--very different from the complex plan we developed today. While this was disappointing, the rover is safe and will likely recover quickly. When planning is "restricted" as it was today, because Mars and Earth time our out of sync, we have to accept the risk that we will not receive data from the rover in time to respond to it.</p>

<p>I served as SOWG Chair for Sol 174 planning, which includes the first use of the drill on Mars. Drill tailings will not be collected during this test, which will use only the percussion (not rotation) <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1419" target="_blank">drilling mode</a>. MAHLI images will be taken before and after the drill activity, so the effect of the percussion on the outcrop target should be easy to assess. To enable SAM analysis of one of the "blank" samples brought from Earth on Sol 175, the Sol 174 plan has to leave the rover batteries nearly fully charged at the time of handover to the Sol 175 plan. This didn't leave much room for activities in addition to the drill test, but we were able to squeeze in ChemCam, DAN, Mastcam, and REMS observations.</p>

Preparations for the first drilling activities continue to go well. The focus of the Sol 170 and 171 plans was to test the ability of arm to press the drill against the surface. Four targets were selected for the "preload" testing, and the arm was left pressed against one of them overnight, to see how the pressure changed with temperature. I was MAHLI uplink lead over the weekend, and helped plan images of the 4 targets before and after the preload tests. The goal of these images is to look at changes in the surface caused by pushing the drill against it.

Today is the 9th anniversary of Opportunity's landing on Mars. Her twin Mars Exploration Rover, Spirit, sent her last transmission to Earth in 2010, after over 6 years of successful operation on the surface of Mars. Not bad, considering the nominal mission lifetime of the MER rovers was 90 days. If MSL exceeds its one-Mars-year lifetime by a similar factor, it will outlive me! Speaking of MSL, the first nighttime MAHLI images are <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-032" target="_blank">available</a>. Images were taken with the white-light LEDs as well as ultraviolet LEDs. The latter are used to look for fluorescent minerals. As shown <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-032#4" target="_blank">here</a>, the MAHLI calibration target includes a fluorescent swatch that confirms that the UV LEDs are working. Fluorescence of the Martian surface is not obvious, but analysis continues...

The Sol 167 plan includes a MAHLI mosaic of the area that can be reached by the drill, to allow more precise selection of drill targets. Also planned are higher-resolution MAHLI and APXS observations of the top two drill targets, and RMI images of the drill tip. Because the rover will be in this location for several weeks while the drill is being tested and we hope used to deliver samples to SAM and CheMin, we are also acquiring a full Navcam panorama to enable Mastcam and ChemCam observations of the surrounding terrain to be accurately pointed.

For Sol 159, we planned MAHLI imaging of one more rock outcrop before stowing the arm and driving about 1 meter backward. The goal of this short "bump" is to allow us to use the arm instruments to investigate spherical objects in the rock that some team members have interpreted as concretions--blobs of minerals that probably precipitated as water/brines cooled and/or evaporated. See examples of these <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/multimedia/pia16569.html" target="_blank">concretions</a>. The biggest challenge today was to return all of the data we need for Sol 160 planning, because the volume of data we expect to be able to return to Earth via the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is smaller than usual.

I was SOWG Chair for Sol 158 planning, and it was an exciting sol. On Sol 156, there was a minor problem with the arm that caused the team to preclude more arm contact science until the anomaly was better understood. Fortunately, good work in the testbed at JPL yesterday verified that the problem was well understood, and we got the go ahead for contact science on Sol 158 just in time to make it happen. This includes APXS and MAHLI observations of two targets, plus a nice MAHLI mosaic of the <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=FLA_411419968EDR_F0051954FHAZ00316M_&amp;s=157" target="_blank">rock ledge</a> in front of the rover.

A short "bump" toward slightly younger rocks in front of the rover was planned for Sol 151, and no MAHLI observations were included so I had an easy day as PUL.

In order to characterize the geology and chemistry of the rocks at the edge of Yellowknife Bay, we intend to repeat the set of brushing, APXS, MAHLI, ChemCam and Mastcam activities at the new location starting on Sol 152. These activities won't be planned until Tuesday, because we are taking a day off Monday while Mars and Earth schedules sync up again. About every 5 weeks, such a "skip" sol is scheduled, giving Earthlings a break, but the rover won't notice.

We planned some ChemCam observations of calibration targets before heating up the instrument, and a CheMin calibration activity in preparation for analyzing the first drill sample. It was an easier day for the planning team, and my shift as SOWG Chair lasted less than 9 hours (Sol 147 planning took more like the nominal 11 hours).</p>

Sol 134 planning was restricted (data arrived too late to affect planning) so we focused on ChemCam calibration observations. Therefore, it was not a complicated planning day and I recognized that combining the SOWG Chair and SUR jobs would not be difficult. Sol 135 was the last one planned tactically before the holiday break. While I'm disappointed that MSL will be relatively idle during the break, I and the rest of the operations team are ready for a vacation.</p>

I was Geology Science Theme Group Lead today for the first time in several weeks, and it ended up being a busy day. We had to pick the location we want to park the rover during the Christmas/New Year's holiday break, and drive there on Sol 133 so that we get the images taken from the new location before the last planning session before the break. We are in "restricted" planning again, because Mars and Earth time our out of sync enough that we don't get data from the rover in time to plan the next sol. Therefore, we can't precisely target observations from the new location until Sol 135. We decided to drive to a place with a good view of the outcrops surrounding <a href="/msl/images/pia16554-sol130-map-br2.jpg" target="_blank">Yellowknife Bay</a> to allow good imaging of these outcrops before the holiday break.

<p>Planning went more smoothly for Sol 130, mostly because there was no uncertainty about the use of the arm. The biggest decision was whether to use the arm to acquire more APXS and MAHLI data on another target before driving away. Once the data from the Sol 129 observations were verified as good enough (including the <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00129/mhli/0129MH0154001000C0_DXXX.jpg" target="_blank">highest-resolution MAHLI images acquired yet</a>), we concluded that observing other targets with ChemCam and Mastcam was more important.

We have been waiting for the remaining soil sample in CHIMRA to be dumped before the arm instruments can be fully used again. The Sol 128 plan included cleaning the sample out of CHIMRA and taking Mastcam images to confirm that the cleaning was successful. If that went well, we could plan "contact science" with the arm on Sol 129. But the confirming data would not be analyzed until the beginning of the SOWG meeting, so we had to formulate contingency plans while we waited for the go-ahead for contact science. This made for a difficult planning day for the team. As SOWG Chair, I had to make quick decisions and rush through the meeting, but I was happy with the plan when we were through. We got the word that CHIMRA was clean a bit earlier than expected, and proceeded to plan observations of 2 targets in front of the rover with APXS and MAHLI. We also planned ChemCam and Mastcam observations, plus DAN active neutron spectroscopy in our new location.

Again, there were no MAHLI or MARDI activities planned during my last sol (for a while) as PUL. But lots of ChemCam and Mastcam observations of local rock targets were planned, along with SAM's 4th analysis of soil. The previous measurements of the soil show evidence for a variety of compounds, perhaps including organics. But the organics may have been brought from <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1399" target="_blank">Earth</a>, so further analyses are needed to confirm this.

I will be on vacation for a week, but will try to keep track of what MSL is up to.

I'm MAHLI/MARDI PUL1 again today, and again no MAHLI or MARDI activities made it into the plan. The focus of the Sol 114 plan is to deliver another sample of the wind ripple to SAM. The last scoop sample was saved in CHIMRA to allow the option of analyzing another sample; we are exercising that option now. This new SAM analysis of the scoop sample is motivated in part by the desire to better understand the results of the previous SAM analysis. The preliminary results will be reported at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1398" target="_blank">next week</a>. About 20,000 scientists are expected to attend this meeting, so I expect that the MSL session will be well attended.

I'm back on tactical operations today, this time as MAHLI/MARDI Payload Uplink Lead.

We've received much of the data acquired during the Thanksgiving holiday, including the Mastcam panorama of Yellowknife Bay, the near-term drive goal. These images will be used to pick specific targets for drilling. Meanwhile, a short "bump" of about 1 meter was planned on Sol 112, to allow arm contact on the <a href="/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00104/opgs/edr/fcam/FRA_406728828EDR_F0050388FHAZ00302M_.JPG" target="_blank">rock</a> under the rover's left front wheel. Planning is still "restricted" for a few sols until Mars and Earth time get back in synch, so we can't plan drive or arm activities every day because we need data showing the position of the rover/arm before planning new rover/arm motions.

The "touch and go" planned for Sol 102 <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1394" target="_blank">went well</a>, the data arriving in time for planning Sol 104. There was a lot of discussion of whether to "bump" the rover a few meters farther to improve the view toward <a href="/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4880" target="_blank">Yellowknife Bay</a>, our near-term drive objective. Ultimately we decided to stay put, which allowed us to accurately target Mastcam mosaics in the Sol 105-107 plan. I was SOWG Chair for this first of 2 "multisol" plans which would allow the operations team to take a break during the Thanksgiving holiday. Because it was the first time we had planned more than one sol's worth of activities at a time, we kept the plan simple. In addition to the Mastcam mosaics, we planned some atmospheric observations and DAN (neutron spectrometer) measurements in our new location. This planning approach worked well, without stressing the tactical team very much. Still, I was glad when we were done, as I needed a break from tactical operations to catch up on other work before the holiday. Happy Thanksgiving!

<p>
Overall, my first shift as SOWG Chair since the transition to remote operations went well. The better tool for sharing video on the web was not working again today, so we had to resort to the backup tool, which again was slower and frustrating at times. But we couldn't plan much science anyway because today was a "restricted" sol. On of the disadvantages of working on "Earth time" (reasonable hours Pacific time) is that, almost half the time, we receive data from MSL too late in the day to react to it tactically. So we have to plan a day in advance, and assume that the previously planned activities went well. We planned a 35-meter drive yesterday, but won't know how it went until late this afternoon. Therefore, we could plan only activities that didn't depend on accurate knowledge of the rover position and orientation. The most important activity we planned for Sol 103 is a checkout of MSL's drill, which won't take too long, so we had room for opportunistic science activities. These included a DAN active measurement of the hydrogen below the surface at our new location, and a 180-degree Navcam panorama to complete the coverage of the area surrounding the rover. We'll use the latter to plan observations over the Thanksgiving holiday, assuming all goes well.

I'm back on tactical operations tomorrow as SOWG Chair, so I'm following along with Sol 102 planning to get up to speed after being away at the ChemCam team meeting. The rover drove to a nearby rock target yesterday, and the plan is to drive 35 meters on Sol 102 after placing the APXS on the nearby rock target for a short chemistry measurement. The rover will stop early in the drive to look back at the scuff in the ripple using Mastcam. This is a fairly complex plan, and I'm happy to see that the ops team is taking it on. We had some trouble with one of the web video sharing tools today, so had to use a backup system that is slower (long delay relative to phone/real time). Otherwise, remote operations are going well and MSL is healthy. It helps that I can recognize most of the voices on the phone!

The ChemCam science team meeting went well, but we have a lot of work to do. Of course everyone knew this before the meeting, and now we are more focused on the most important tasks. We have a lot of excellent data, and the most important near-term goal is to broaden the range of rocks and minerals in the database that is used to match Mars spectra with known materials. We knew roughly what to expect before MSL delivered ChemCam to Mars, and built the database appropriately. But it is clear that expanding the database will improve the fidelity of the mineralogic modeling, so it must be done soon. I presented my work on RMI image compression testing, which is much less important but will allow us to significantly reduce the data volume of each image, in turn allowing us to acquire and return more images to Earth.

I'm at the Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland for a ChemCam science team meeting this week. The location was chosen, in part, to make traveling easier overall--it's between France and JPL. Some of the team members are supporting MSL tactical operations so that the rest of us can focus on the meeting. It's nice to take a break from operations and think about ChemCam data analysis and interpretation, but difficult to keep up with what the rover is doing. One of the people who is working operations reported that the latest SAM analysis had to be pulled out of yesterday's plan because there wasn't enough power to do it and the decontamination heating that ChemCam needs every week or so. This must have been very frustrating for the operations team!

The plan for Sol 96 was dominated by continued arm activities, with little room for "opportunistic science." So my last shift as SUR (this week) was fairly easy. The plan included dropping another soil sample into the SAM instrument, with Mastcam and MAHLI support imaging. As we stepped through each sequence in detail, I was again impressed by the complexity of the arm, CHIMRA in particular. Fortunately, there is a team of very capable engineers who are focused on operating the arm. Thanks to them, the arm activities have been going well. I'm getting more used to remote operations, but following the details of various discussions is still challenging.

There was applause in the MSL SOWG meeting room and on the phone lines as the first SAM results on solid Martian material were announced. The instrument appears to be working well, and the team is busy analyzing the new data. The plan for Sol 95 therefore included another SAM "preconditioning" activity to prepare for another scoop sample. The more complicated part of the plan involved lots of arm motion to process and drop the rest of the scoop 5 sample to the observation tray and measure it with APXS. This will allow results from various instruments to be compared, which will allow the team to more fully understand the detailed composition of the soil sample and to compare the calibration of the instruments. MAHLI images of the material on the observation tray will be taken to determine how much material is measured by APXS. It was nearly midnight in Flagstaff when my shift ended, almost like being on Mars time!

The X-ray diffraction instrument will then analyze the sample overnight. There was enough power and time left for a couple Mastcam mosaics in the afternoon.

I served as Science Uplink Representative (SUR) for the first time since Sol 3. The operations schedule has been significantly <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1389" target="_blank">compressed since then</a>, so had less time to get my job done. And this was my first tactical shift since the transition to remote operations, which added the challenge of interacting with the rest of the team from my office in Flagstaff. We had some trouble with the web broadcast tool that were overcome by starting over a couple times, otherwise planning went well. The SUR is the science team lead for the second shift, so I ended up working until almost 11 PM local time. This would have been less of a problem if the first storm of the season hit Flagstaff the same night. During a break between the last two sequence reviews, I decided to drive home before the roads got icy. It was more difficult to participate in the last meeting using my laptop and home phone, but it worked. Hopefully the weather will be better for Sol 95 planning.

I made it home to Flagstaff last night despite being detoured by a fire that closed I-15 near Cajon Pass. I verified that the web tools and phone access to the MSL tactical planning meetings worked well, and followed the SOWG meeting planning Sol 91. The tools are similar to those we have been using for the Opportunity rover, so it was easy for me to get connected. So while it would be nice to still be working operations at JPL, it's good to be home and I'm confident that remote operations will work well. I'm not staffed in a tactical shift until Friday, so was not fully engaged in planning today. But it's clear that all is going well. The focus is on preparing SAM for delivery of its first solid sample, which involved a "dry run" that went well and preconditioning on Sol 91. Most SAM activities require a lot of power, as expected, so there wasn't much room for other science. But the science team squeezed in some ChemCam and Navcam observations, along with the normal background REMS, DAN and RAD measurements.

I served as SOWG Chair for my last MSL tactical shift on Mars time. It was bittersweet: I'll miss working with the whole team at JPL, but I'm looking forward to going home. We are learning how to more effectively operate the rover with most of the team being "remote" (working from their home institutions rather than in residence at JPL). The transition to remote operations is going well, but we are still working to find better ways to communicate. We have multiple videoconferencing lines set up, but it impossible for the tactical leadership to call in to all of them. We are also using internet chat rooms for the various groups, which is easier to follow. We also schedule tagup meetings to make sure everyone is on the same page at key points in the planning process. The techniques we are using will continue to evolve as we get more experience with remote operations.
</p><p>
Sol 89 planning went well, with the biggest challenge being how to get the data we need to proceed with SAM and scooping activities later this week. Mars Odyssey is not available this week for data relay, and MRO won't go right over MSL on Sol 89. So we won't get much data from MSL until Sol 90. If all goes well, we will have just enough information to allow us to proceed with the Sol 91 plan.

The only instrument that will not be acquiring new data is CheMin. I'm getting more used to the compressed tactical schedule and the tools we need to enable remote operations. So is the rest of the operations team, which is good because most of the science team will be leaving JPL next week.

The MAHLI "self portrait" of the rover that we planned on Sol 84 came out <a href="/msl/images/pia16239_c-br2.jpg" target="_blank">beautifully</a>. Several other updates on the MSL mission are related to the <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1386" target="_blank">news conference</a> this morning, which included discussion of SAM atmospheric measurements. The SAM data indicate that much of Mars' atmosphere has <a href="/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4849" target="_blank">escaped</a>, as suspected based on previous studies. The rate of atmospheric escape is greater on Mars than on Earth because of the difference in gravity--if you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, you would weigh only 38 pounds on Mars. This difference makes it easier for gas molecules to fly away from Mars, and for the effects of these losses to be measured.

I served as SOWG chair today, and struggled to catch up with what had happened in the 2 days I took off since my last tactical shift. Fortunately, there were several people at JPL who had been working operations while I was away, and they helped me get up to speed quickly. The reports saved each sol on the team web site were also helpful, as usual, and will become even more important as we transition to remote operations next week.

The SAM "pre-conditioning" was successful, so the next scoop of soil will be delivered to SAM. As MAHLI PUL for the last time this week, I helped plan a "self-portrait" of the rover from the camera on the end of MSL's arm. It should yield a nice view of the entire rover, including the remote sensing mast that holds the cameras that usually take pictures of the rover: the stereo Mastcams and Navcams, and the ChemCam LIBS and camera combination. It addition, we planned more stereo images of the rocks right in front of the rover to extend the topographic map of the area surrounding them. This map is needed to ensure that the arm instruments (especially APXS) can be deployed on these rocks.

As a bonus, almost 1 gigabit of data were received on Sol 81! I was MAHLI payload uplink lead for Sol 82 planning, and had to scramble to get up to speed after being away for a few days. A lot of good MAHLI observations were proposed, and most of them made it into the plan: Stereo observations of two rocks near the left front wheel that cannot be well imaged by the Navigation cameras, and a couple images of the latest scoop trench. The stereo MAHLI images will hopefully be useful in determining whether the APXS can measure the chemistry of these rocks.

Mars time is getting closer to Pacific Daylight Time these days--my shift didn't start until 6:30 this morning.

As the MSL operations team gets more experience, we are getting more aggressive.

The ChemCam observations are intended to see whether water frost forms on the surface during the night, by comparing the amount of hydrogen seen in the LIBS spectra when the soil is warm and cold.

<p>
The team applauded the first results from CheMin, which show that the instrument is working well, measuring abundances of minerals in the sandy <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1379" target="_blank">first sample</a> delivered to it. The CheMin scientists thanked the Surface Sampling Subsystem team for doing such a good job delivering the first sample, and there was another round of applause.
</p><p>
The plan for Sol 73 is dominated by more arm activities, processing another scooped sample through CHIMRA to further clean out any terrestrial contamination before a sample is delivered to SAM, which is very sensitive to organic material. We don't want to put any organic material from Earth into SAM! There wasn't much room in the plan for additional science observations, but we were able to squeeze in a MAHLI image of the <a href="/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4816">observation tray</a> to see whether the soil placed on it during Sol 70 slid or blew off the tray.

MRO is back--we received over 400 Mbits of data through the orbiter yesterday! The amount of data relayed through MRO will decrease once the orbiter's instruments are operating again (they were turned on this morning), but in the meantime we're enjoying the flood of data. Among the new data were 810 ChemCam laser shots acquired on Sol 71--a new record for a single sol. For Sol 72, we planned a raster of ChemCam laser shots of the bright particle "Schmutz2" in the second scoop <a href="/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4817">trench</a>. And the much-anticipated first mineralogical analysis by CheMin was planned to run into the early morning of Sol 73.
</p><p>
"Mars time" is rough for those of us on first shift these days: The daily "science discussion" started at 10 PM PDT, and I wasn't done with SOWG Chair duties until 7:30 this morning. It didn't seem fair that I got caught in morning rush hour traffic on my way home! But I've realized that this may be the last time I'll work on "Mars time" in my career--it looks like there will not be another NASA spacecraft landed on Mars this decade--so I'm trying to enjoy it. In fact, I'm getting used to being a Martian, even though sleeping during the day is difficult.

The third scoop of soil was successfully acquired, and partly processed by CHIMRA, dumping part of it on the <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NRA_403711601EDR_S0050104NCAM00333M_&amp;s=70">observation tray</a>. So MSL is back on track despite the unavailability of MRO data relay and other communications problems. MRO has exited safe mode and is expected to resume relaying MSL data today. The plan for Sol 71 is to use CHIMRA to sieve the sample and deliver it to CheMin, the mineralogy instrument inside the rover. It will be the first Mars sample for CheMin, an event that has been eagerly anticipated. The Mastcam will then take pictures of CheMin's sample inlet to confirm that all went well. Other Mastcam and ChemCam observations were also planned for Sol 71. I was not scheduled in a tactical role the past 2 sols, so have been catching up on other work before I'm back on as SOWG Chair for Sols 72-74.

<h2 class="title">Sol 69 Update on Curiosity from USGS Scientist Ken Herkenhoff: Pushing Data</h2>
<p class="date">October 15, 2012 - Monday</p>
<div class="description">
<p>
The command sequences prepared for Sol 68 were not received by MSL due to a problem with a radio transmitter at a Deep Space Network ground station. But enough data were received from earlier sols that we were confident that we could resume scooping on a new site, where contamination was not seen in close-up MAHLI images. So the Sol 69 plan includes some of the activities we intended to perform on Sol 68, plus scooping and documentation imaging of the new site. I was MAHLI/MARDI uplink lead, so was busy making sure that we planned the MAHLI images we need, working with the rover planners to optimize the plan.
</p>
<p>
About halfway into the Sol 69 planning process, we learned that the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) went into "safe mode." MRO has been in safe mode several times during its mission, and has recovered every time, so we expect that the orbiter will recover quickly. But it reminds us how much MSL depends on the orbiters--we will not be able to use MRO for data relay for at least a couple days. While we can still receive MSL data through Mars Odyssey, the data volume is typically greater via MRO. And it is possible to receive data directly from MSL to Earth, but data volumes are even lower. So we hope that the MRO project will be able to understand and recover from this anomaly quickly.

The MAHLI image of the "schmutz" in the 2nd scoop trench (at lower left in <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00067/mhli/0067MH0079000007R0_DXXX.jpg">photo</a>) shows that it is brighter than anything else in the image, but it's still not clear what it is. In case it is debris from MSL, a nearby area of the same sandy ripple will be imaged by MAHLI to determine whether similar debris is present there. If not, the plan is to scoop that target. MAHLI images of other potential scoop targets were also planned, along with Mastcam, ChemCam, and other observations. It was my last shift as ChemCam PEL, and I was glad that we were able to squeeze in another instrument characterization activity, intended to determine the best gain setting for RMI imaging. The results of this test will be used to improve the quality of future RMI images.

<div class="description">
<p>
Less than half of the ChemCam data acquired on Sol 66 have been received so far, but it looks like the activities we planned before the decontamination heating went well. So we requested another titanium calibration target observation in Sol 67, and the theme groups requested a new 3x3 LIBS raster on the rock "Pearson" and 2 RMI images of the 2nd scoop trench. Initially, the RMI images were planned in the early afternoon, so that the images would be returned to Earth right away and be used to study the bright spot seen in a Right Mastcam image of the scoop trench. But concerns that the bright spot is more material shed from the flight system, and that some of this terrestrial material is in the scooped dirt, led the tactical team to decide to dump the scoop and take MAHLI images of the scoop targets first. This freed up enough time in the plan that we could combine the ChemCam observations into a single block, which we preferred to save time. Because the MAHLI images replaced the RMI images as the data needed to determine what is causing the bright spot, this change was approved. It looks we will not continue scooping activities on Sol 68, as we don't want to put any terrestrial material into CHIMRA, and certainly not in the analytical instruments!

<p>
The Sol 66 plan includes the second scooping activity on the same sandy ripple, again intended to be used to flush out the CHIMRA system, removing any remaining terrestrial contamination. This won't take the entire sol, and there were a couple blocks of time available for science observations. So it was a busy day (actually night, with my shift starting at 5 PM PDT) for the science team, preparing and prioritizing potential observations. I was focused on ChemCam again as PEL, and our top priority was to run our decontamination heaters for 2 hours. We have been doing this approximately weekly to ensure that gases released within the rover body when it was warm (during cruise to Mars) have not condensed on ChemCam's detectors. Ideally, LIBS (laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy) measurements of our titanium calibration target should be acquired soon before and after the decontamination heating, to see whether instrument performance has changed. The problem with doing this is that just cooling down and turning on the instrument takes about 40 minutes, so fitting it in with other science observations isn't easy. But the team recognized the importance of this instrument maintenance and it made it into the plan along with Mastcam, MAHLI, DAN, RAD, and REMS observations. Hopefully it will all go well and we will be able to squeeze in another (post-decontamination) ChemCam observation of the titanium target in the Sol 67 plan.

After much analysis and discussion, the MSL project decided that the <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1372">bright object</a> on the ground is benign and that we can therefore proceed with the long-anticipated first sample manipulation <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1374">activities</a>. These activities are complex enough that there was not room in the Sol 64 plan for "opportunistic science," so the science team focused on activities to be included in the plans for future sols. I worked with the folks in charge of long-term planning to figure out when we can fit a ChemCam decontamination (heating) activity that should be done every week or so. It's looking like Sol 66 will work, but of course the plan may change...

The data from <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1369">Sol 58</a> show that the ripple is suitable for scooping, so the Sol 59 plan includes a short rover drive to position the rover near a part of the ripple that has not been disturbed yet. The MAHLI images of the wall are <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00058/mhli/0058MH0030001000E1_DXXX.jpg">beautiful</a> and show that the interior of the ripple is mostly fine-grained sand. The grain sizes in the ripple are just what is needed to test and clean the CHIMRA. The layer of coarse grains on the surface of the ripple <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00058/mhli/0058MH0028001000C0_DXXX.jpg">is thin</a> and is covered by only a thin layer of dust.
</p><p>
We expect to get a large volume of data through MRO in the afternoon of Sol 59, so planning was relatively easy. We were able to include all of the science observations requested by the team, including the first half of a "long-baseline stereo" Mastcam mosaic. The Sol 59 drive should place the rover 1.1 m to the north of the current location, which will provide a nice offset for stereo images taken looking east. We targeted an interesting area south of Glenelg that we don't plan to visit before leaving this area, so this is a good opportunity to image it before descending to Glenelg.

I'm back at JPL, serving as SOWG Chair planning Sol 57. The mission continues to go very well, with recent drives executed nearly perfectly. The rover is now positioned near a windblown ripple that is the current target of both scientific and engineering study. As I mentioned previously, we have been looking for a relatively fine-grained soil patch to scoop into CHIMRA, the "Collection and Handling for Interior Martian Rock Analysis" subsystem. CHIMRA will be used to sieve and portion samples into the CheMin and SAM instruments for mineralogic and organic chemical analysis. But before such samples will be delivered, some Martian soil will be used to clean any terrestrial contamination from CHIMRA by passing it through the system. So today's plan included the first "scuff" by one of the rover wheels, intended to measure the depth of the ripple and determine whether it is safe to scoop it. To scuff, the left front wheel will be rolled over the ripple, then that wheel will be rotated while the other 5 wheels are held stationary. This should allow a cross-section of the ripple to be imaged, and the composition of the interior of the ripple to be examined. After the scuff is complete, the rover will move back to essentially its current position to allow the arm to be used to place the MAHLI and APXS instruments into the scuffed area.

It doesn't look like much, but it's the first one we've been close to so it was the target of ChemCam and Mastcam observations planned for Sol 50. We are currently searching for a larger ripple or windblown drift for the first use of MSL's scoop, and these observations should help us determine how suitable such a ripple would be for scooping. The goal is to find a fine-grained deposit that can be "fed" to the mechanism on the arm that will be used to crush and sort samples before they are delivered to the mineralogy and chemistry experiments inside the rover. Processing a sandy sample will not only test this mechanism, it will sweep out any terrestrial contamination still remaining in it. The entire rover was carefully cleaned before launch, but it is very difficult to remove all traces of Earth, so passing Martian soil through the mechanism will "clean" it out. </p><p>Another drive was planned for Sol 50, after the ripple observations. The Geology Theme Group focused on post-drive imaging, working with the Rover Planners to get the images they need to plan the following drive. We planned full 360-degree Navcam and Mastcam panoramas from the new location, which should allow us to pick a good soil target for scooping. Only the Navcam (wide-angle) images will be received in time to be used for planning Sol 51 observations, so we will use those images to determine which of the Mastcam images should be sent to Earth right away. If we see a good ripple or fine-grained soil patch nearby, we will probably drive over to it and scoop it up.</p>

"Mars time" is getting closer to PDT, with first shift starting around 6 AM today. Lots of good news and applause today: The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) received its first data from a Mars rock, the first MAHLI close-up images of the <a href="/msl-raw-images/msss/00046/mhli/0046MH0011004000E1_DXXX.jpg">same rock</a>, and the first mass spectrometer
measurement of the Martian atmosphere from SAM. But not all of the news was good...
</p><p>
I was SOWG Chair for Sol 47 planning, and was expecting an "easy" day for the science team because the long-anticipated arm activities had been planned well in advance and there would be no time in the plan for "opportunistic science." Well, that all changed quickly when we received the Sol 46 data that showed the ChemCam Remote Microscopic Imager (RMI) images all completely out of focus. The automatic focusing system had clearly failed, and successful focusing was required before the ChemCam laser could be fired at the same target today. So we had to scramble to recover from this anomaly and acquire ChemCam diagnostic data that would allow the engineering team to determine what had gone wrong. We were hoping to use ChemCam to measure the chemistry of the same spot on the rock "Jake Matijevic" that would be measured by the APXS before driving away on Sol 48, but it quickly became clear that this would not be possible. Instead, we decided to move the APXS spot to the place on the rock where ChemCam had previously acquired less extensive data. While not what we originally had in mind, it will allow us to proceed toward Glenelg as planned.

The Sol 45 rover "bump" was executed perfectly, putting the rover in position to deploy the arm instruments to the rock "Jake Matijevic" and shoot it with ChemCam's laser. So the Sol 46 plan includes the long-awaited first use of the arm on a rock target. I look forward to seeing the close-up MAHLI images of this rock.
</p><p>
I feel very luck to be working on the MSL project, and even luckier today that I got to see the space shuttle "Endeavor" fly right over JPL on a 747! It then landed at the LA airport, to be trucked to the California Science Center in Exposition Park where it will be permanently displayed.

The high-resolution color images of "Jake Matijevic" show that one face of the rock is clean (dust-free) enough for detailed study using the instruments on MSL's arm. So the Sol 45 plan includes a "bump" (short rover drive) to get close enough to reach it with the arm. We also planned ChemCam laser shots on the rock before the bump to see how much its chemistry varies on millimeter scales. After the drive, late afternoon images of Aeolis Mons (the huge mountain in the middle of Gale crater, informally known as Mt. Sharp) were planned. Previous images of Aeolis Mons were taken with the sun high in the sky, so that subtle topography is difficult to see. The new mosaic should be spectacular, but will take days to weeks to return to Earth because of the large volume of data involved.

Once again, the rover planners (drivers) displayed their ability to
position MSL accurately, leaving the rover right <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1353">where we wanted</a>.
It looks like the rock named "Jake Matijevic" will suffice for the first examination of Mars by the Alpha
Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and close-up imaging by the Mars Hand
Lens Imager (MAHLI). The Sol 44 plan included Mastcam color imaging of "
Jake Matijevic" that will be used to decide whether this rock is suitable
for the long-anticipated arm activities. The rock was named after a
pioneering JPL robotics expert who played a major role in the development
and operation of the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and MSL rovers. I am
lucky to have known Jake; we met during preparations for the Mars
Pathfinder (and Sojourner) mission in the mid-1990s. His name is still
posted outside his JPL office in the MSL operations area, and I'm sad every
time I walk past it. He would have loved to see how well MSL is doing.
</p><p>
We all celebrated the Mastcam images of the
<a href="/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4687">Phobos transit</a>. I've
enjoyed astronomy since I was a child, but astronomical observations from
the surface of Mars are a special treat! Similar observations have been
made from the Spirt and Opportunity rovers, but the new Mastcam images have
much higher resolution. Such observations are not top priority for Mars
rovers, but opportunities to view Phobos and Deimos transits are rare
enough that considerable effort it put in to planning them. Because the
Opportunity rover is at about the same latitude as MSL (near the equator),
observations of solar transits by the Martian satellites were also planned
today by the Opportunity team.

<div class="description">
<p>
A couple of transits of Mars' moon across the face of the sun were observed
by Mastcam. These are similar to solar eclipses on Earth, but because the
Martian moons are so much smaller than Earth's moon, they do not completely
block the sun. But they are still fun to watch and scientifically useful,
as they allow the position of the moons to be determined and their orbits
to be precisely updated. The rate of change of the moon's orbits is
affected by the interior structure of Mars, so in a way the transits are
geophysical observations.
</p><p>
I was SOWG Chair for Sol 43 planning, and I was busy because it was an
ambitious plan: ChemCam characterization in morning, followed by a ~30
meter drive toward a dark boulder that may become the target of close-up
investigation using the arm. On the morning of Sol 44, the rover will wake
up early to look for frost or fog before dawn, then take a big Mastcam
panorama toward the northwest while the lighting is good.

The Sol 41 drive went well, but we are still on relatively featureless
terrain. We planned another drive for Sol 42, and a huge Mastcam mosaic
from the new position. It is pointed toward Glenelg and the surrounding
area, and will be used to identify interesting targets for future
investigations.
</p><p>
Another first-time activity was completed on Sol 41: Active neutron
spectrometry during the drive. These data will allow variations in
hydrogen (most likely in hydrated, or water-rich minerals) within about 1
meter of the surface to be measured in greater detail. Such variations
have already been detected between the places the rover has stopped.

Our work schedule is getting closer to normal workday hours, with first
shift starting around 4 AM these days. By the end of September our
schedule will be close to that of most Earthlings in California!

Once again the drive went well and we planned another drive on Sol 41. The
terrain is relatively featureless in this area, so we are focusing imaging
plans on distant targets. We are on a relatively high plateau so the views
toward the rim of Gale crater are better than they were from the landing
site. The path to Glenelg is mostly (slightly) downhill from here, so the
distant views are as good as they will get for a while.
</p><p>
The amount of time we have to plan each sol's activities is a bit shorter
than usual these days due to unusually long delays in relaying the data
from MSL through the Mars orbiters. So we are not able to plan as many
scientific observations, but are still able to drive each sol. ChemCam is
working well and returning good data again.

Once again, the drive went well, and we are 20 meters closer to Glenelg,
our near-term goal. The terrain surrounding the rover at the end of the
Sol 39 drive is not as interesting as the previous location, so we didn't
plan many observations besides those needed to support drive planning. But
the plan included some ChemCam observations, as the instrument team is now
ready to resume tactical planning. Hooray! The Sol 40 drive will be a bit
longer, over 30 meters, and should get us to a low ridge that will give us
a better view of the terrain ahead.
</p><p>
I was reminded again today how diverse the MSL team is. Okay, white males
make up the majority of the team, but women serve in many of the most
important roles, including Mission Manager, Deputy Project Scientist,
Tactical Uplink Lead (mostly women), and Science Theme Lead. Most
impressive is the number of team members from foreign countries, including
Spain, Russia, and France, for whom English is a second (or third)
language. They are required to understand all of the team discussions and
respond to questions in English, despite the highly technical nature of the
subject matter. Some of the engineering jargon is unfamiliar to many of us
who are native English speakers! For example, "IPE supra-tactical reported
replacement of the MOB backbone in tosol's APAM and deconfliction of the
margin after the mobility block." Hard enough to understand when English
is your first language--I'm really impressed by the foreign nationals'
ability to do such a good job in these conditions.

The drive went as planned, and left MSL next to a <a href="/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=NLA_400871566EDR_F0040404NCAM00409M_&amp;s=38">
nice outcrop</a> During the drive the DAN instrument monitored neutrons coming up from the
subsurface and noticed significant variations along the way. It's not
known (at least to me) what causes these variations, but possibilities
include hydrated minerals, water ice (unlikely?), and density variations.
Another drive is planned for Sol 39 (about 20 meters this time), so a bunch
of images of the outcrop were planned before the drive. Unfortunately, we
aren't expecting to get much data through the orbiters tomorrow, so we
probably won't see these images for a while. Worse, we may not get enough
Navcam images after the Sol 39 drive to plan more observations in the new
location. The amount of data that can be relayed to the orbiters depends
on how high in the sky they pass over MSL, which varies a lot day to day.
In addition the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is turning instruments
back on, which may interfere with MSL radio communications. Therefore,
telemetry rates are set low to ensure that we get at least some data while
characterizing the radio link with the instruments turned on. Most of
MRO's instruments were off during MSL landing to maximize the amount of
data that could be relayed from MSL. The instruments are resuming
scientific data collection after the hiatus for MSL.

With the successful execution of the last of the MSL arm checkout
<a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1346">activities</a>, the characterization phase is complete! Many first-time activities still lie ahead (like drilling, scooping, and delivering samples to the
mineralogy and organic chemistry instruments), but the major capabilities
of the rover have been demonstrated. So after spending over a week in the
same place to complete the characterization, the Sol 38 plan included a
32-meter drive toward the east. The near-term goal is "Glenelg," still a
few hundred meters away
<a href="/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4626">few hundred meters away</a>. Images taken from orbit show that Glenelg is at the junction of 3 different
terrain types, the brightest of which may be ancient lakebed sediments. It
will take several sols to get to Glenelg, and we are hoping that the
driving goes well.

The ChemCam instrument was confirmed to be safe, but will not be used again
until Friday to give the ChemCam team a chance to rest and regroup. The
team met at the end of the planning day (7:30 PDT) to review the data
received so far and to plan the next steps. By the time of this meeting I
had been up all night, so I was pretty tired but it was a good meeting, and
kept me off the freeway until rush hour traffic cleared a bit.
</p><p>
It was my last shift as MAHLI/MARDI Payload Uplink Lead this week, and
ended up being fairly busy because the MSL science team requested more
MARDI images at various times of day to see how useful the images are under
different illumination conditions. We were also able to plan one image at
exactly the same time of day as one taken on Sol 32, to look for changes on
the surface due to winds. So I sat down with one of the rover planners to
look at how much the rover shadows the MARDI field of view at various times
of day. I always enjoy working with the rover planners because their
visualization tools are so COOL. They allow a model of the rover to be
placed on the 3-D terrain derived from stereo images and illuminated by a
fake sun. This model showed that the MARDI images would be partly shadowed
until 15:00, when only a corner of the images would be shadowed by the left
front rover wheel. So we planned a couple images in the late afternoon and
one earlier to span the range of illumination. Based on the preliminary
results of the compression testing I've been doing, I recommended more
compression of the fully-illuminated images, to reduce data volume without
sacrificing image quality. Details in shadows are more difficult to
preserve when the image is compressed, so we left the partly-shadowed image
at the default (minimal) compression.
</p><p>
Although I'm not staffed in a tactical role for a few days, I plan to stay
involved in tactical operations on Mars time, as shifting between Earth and
Mars time is difficult these days.

The checkout of the MSL arm continues to go well: The Alpha Particle X-ray
Spectrometer returned its first data, of its calibration target on the side
of the rover. I was busy last night planning a bunch of MAHLI images to be
taken as part of the verification that the arm can be accurately placed
over the inlets for Chemin and SAM, the mineralogy and organic chemistry
instruments. I also helped plan Mastcam "sky flats," images of the sky to
be used in measuring the variations in response of the camera detectors
across their field of view. Taking pictures of the sky is one of the
techniques used by astronomers to "flat field" their instruments, typically
during evening twilight before a night of observing through a telescope.
It's a bit more difficult to use this technique for the MSL cameras, as
their fields of view are much larger than typical observatory instruments,
and more of the variations in brightness across the sky are visible. To
allow the shape of the sky brightness variations to be measured, we planned
a small mosaic of images around a central image that will be corrected for
these variations. Right after these were approved for the Sol 36 plan, I
remembered that the Navcams can be calibrated using the Mastcam
observations, so I asked if they could be included at the last minute.
Fortunately, the leaders of the planning team agreed to add them!
</p><p>
"Mars time" continues to shift relative to PDT, so by the time I left JPL
it was daylight, and I got stuck in morning rush hour traffic on the way to
my apartment in Pasadena. Fortunately, I won't have this problem for long,
as the MSL work day will keep shifting later. Tonight my shift starts just
before midnight and ends at 10:15 AM PDT. By then the traffic should have
cleared somewhat...

There were more cheers and applause when MAHLI images of the belly of the
rover were <a href="/msl/images/PIA16137-MAHLI-belly-br2.jpg">displayed</a>. The
camera, which can focus at distances from 2 cm to infinity, is working
perfectly! It also took pictures of its <a href="/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4650">calibration target</a>, which
includes a <a href="/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4649">1909 Lincoln penny</a>. The arm
checkout also went well, leaving the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer
(APXS) facing its <a href="/msl/multimedia/images?ImageID=4654">calibration target</a> for a long integration. Unfortunately, ChemCam suffered a command error on Sol 34 and
was shut down by the rover computer. This also prevented the rest of the
planned remote sensing observations from being acquired that sol, and the
remote sensing mast (RSM) from being used on Sol 35. So the Sol 35 plan
was rather simple, including more APXS integration on its calibration
target followed by retraction of the arm. Even though we couldn't use the
RSM, we could still plan a test of Mastcam's video capability, as it
doesn't matter where the cameras are pointed for this test. We are all
hoping that recovery from the ChemCam error will be rapid, and that we will
be able to use it and the rest of the instruments on the RSM tomorrow.

Over a month into the mission, there are still cheers at JPL when
first-time activities are completed successfully. Last night, the latest
successes included the first Chemin X-ray diffraction pattern (of an empty
sample cell), and the first MAHLI image with its dust <a href="/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4646">cover open</a>. Previous
images through MAHLI's dust cover window had much <a href="/msl/images/pia16159_MAHLI-br2.jpg">lower contrast</a>, probably
because dust settled onto it during MSL's landing. So there was some
concern that the dust raised by the landing rockets had gotten under the
cover onto MAHLI's optics. The beautifully clear MAHLI image received
yesterday showed that any such dust contamination was insignificant, and
that the camera is ready to go. So the Sol 34 plan included many MAHLI
images of calibration and other targets on the rover, as part of a thorough
checkout of the arm pointing. As MAHLI/MARDI Payload Uplink Lead for the
first shift last night, I had a lot of MAHLI command sequences to keep
track of, but it wasn't very difficult because the arm checkout had already
been run on the MSL testbed (nearly identical rover in a lab at JPL) and
the sequences built and tested. The checkout includes a mosaic of MAHLI
images looking under the rover, to look for any signs of damage incurred
during landing. I left JPL when my shift was over at 5 AM, and got enough
sleep this morning that I think I have made the transition onto Mars time.

I arrived in Pasadena at about 10 PM last night, and went straight to
JPL to catch up with the MSL team and start my transition to Mars
time. My next shift starts at 9:15 PM tonight. I walked in during a
science team meeting regarding "data management" which sounds boring
but is very important to the team. In addition to the rover
computer's ability to adjust the priority of various data products to
be sent to Earth, each of the color cameras includes an 8 gigabyte
buffer for storing raw images. So we can acquire panoramic mosaics of
many images and return only small "thumbnail" versions of each image
while storing the full-resolution images in the camera buffer. Once
we have looked at the thumbnails, we can return just the full images
of most interest. Obviously this is a nice capability to have, but it
means we have to do more work to keep track of the data onboard the
rover.
</p><p>
I stayed through the end of the SOWG meeting, and left JPL around 3 AM
this morning. On my way out, I talked with Roger Wiens, the PI of
ChemCam. His instrument has been working well, and he wanted to
discuss the results of the RMI compression testing I mentioned last
week. We were both too tired to have the conversation then, and
agreed to talk later. But I summarized my conclusion that, while the
test data in hand are useful in determining the optimum compression
parameters, more test data are needed. Meanwhile, the focus of
near-term rover activities will be <a href="/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1336">checkout of the arm</a>.

I was planning to stay on "Mars time" while in Flagstaff this week, but it would have meant less time with my family, so I haven't been sleeping very late. This has allowed me to call in to Mars Exploration Rover planning meetings at 9 AM and catch up with what Opportunity has been doing. After over 8 years roving on Mars, Opportunity is exploring the rim of a 22-km diameter crater that shows evidence from orbit of clay minerals that were probably formed during a more Earth-like period in Martian history. I'm the science lead for the Microscopic Imager (MI), the close-up camera (like a geologist's hand lens) on the end of Opportunity's instrument arm. The rover is now investigating an outcrop that is unlike any we have seen before. The MI just acquired a 2x2 mosaic of <a href="http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/1/m/3064/1M400198593EFFBVM5P2905M2M1.JPG">images of this outcrop</a>. The abundant spherules seen in these images are generally smaller than the hematite concretions found on the Meridiani plains by Opportunity, and broken ones show more internal structure than the concretions. So they don't appear to be the same kind of concretions, but more data are needed to understand this rock. Today we are finalizing a plan that includes brushing the dust off of this outcrop, taking 4 more MI images to confirm that the brushing worked, and placing the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer on the brushed spot to get elemental chemical information. There are other interesting outcrops in the vicinity of the rover, including some brighter ones that may contain more clay.
</p><p>
So the Opportunity mission is going very well, and I hope to find some time to keep up with it while I'm working on MSL in Pasadena. I will be working graveyard shift, but could drop in on Opportunity planning meetings after my MSL shift if I'm not exhausted. With so much rover activity on Mars these days, it will be difficult to sleep!

The Sol 26 drive went well, and the images taken after the drive showed
some interesting outcrops right in front of the rover. The focus of the
Sol 27 plan is primarily the first sampling of Mars' atmosphere by the big
SAM instrument, so there wasn't much time to do anything else. Now that
ChemCam is working again, the top priority is to acquire better
observations of its calibration target, and 77 minutes were allocated to do
that. But when we saw the new outcrop target, the science team wanted to
take pictures and zap it with ChemCam's laser. So Steve Squyres, the
Mineralogy Science Theme Group Lead for today, asked the Tactical Uplink
Lead (Pauline Hwang) whether she would be willing to consider adding more
time to the plan for additional scientific observations. Steve is the PI
of the Athena science payload on the Mars Exploration Rovers, and because
Pauline used to work on MER, they already know each other. Steve's plea
was well enough received that Pauline agreed to give the science team 40
more minutes to work with. There was much rejoicing, and Mastcam and
ChemCam observations of the outcrop were added to the plan. When I left
JPL a couple hours ago, it appeared that they would be approved and
included in the commands to be sent to MSL early tomorrow morning.
</p><p>
I wasn't scheduled in a tactical role today, but I couldn't resist spending
most of my day at JPL. MSL mission operations are just too much fun to
miss! Because I didn't have to focus on today's planning as much, I was
able to catch up on some other tasks, including processing new MARDI images
to determine how much they can be compressed and still preserve the details
needed for geologic interpretation. I also looked at some older ChemCam
RMI images that were taken in the MSL testbed (a nearly identical copy of
the real rover at JPL) to test various types of image compression. I had
been meaning to get this done long ago, but was too busy with other work.
So far it looks like we will be able to reduce the size of these images
without significantly degrading them. We must make the most of the
precious bits we receive from MSL through the Mars orbiters, so I need to
complete this analysis soon.

<h2 class="title">Sol 26 Update on Curiosity from USGS Scientist Ken Herkenhoff: Mars Time</h2>
<p class="date">September 01, 2012 - Saturday</p>
<div class="description">
<p>
The best news today was that analysis of more detailed ChemCam engineering data showed that the problems noted a few sols ago were very minor and now completely understood, so the instrument can now be used again! While we suspected that the problem was not serious, it was very nice to receive confirmation.
</p><p>
We finally received the images needed to plan the next drive, so the Sol 26 plan includes a checkout of the "visual odometry" software that will be used by the rover to precisely determine how far it has moved using images taken during the drive. Once the data from this and previous driving tests are received and analyzed, all of the rover mobility software will be validated. Of course we are hoping that all goes well, as visual odometry will allow MSL to approach targets accurately enough to put them in the "workspace" of the arm. Even if the rover slips in sand or on a steep slope, it will be able to automatically account for any slip and get where we want to go. This will save lots of time in the future.
</p><p>
Today "Mars time" at Gale crater is about the same as "Earth time" (PDT). The tactical team's workday always starts in the afternoon at Gale, when the rover sends data to the orbiters as they fly overhead. We then work all Mars night to analyze and understand the data MSL has sent to us, then plan what we want the rover to do the next day in time to send the commands the following Mars morning. So today the first shift came in to work in the Earth afternoon, and the second shift will work through the Earth night, finishing up as the sun is rising in Pasadena. Because Mars' day is about 40 minutes longer than an Earth day, our workday will begin later and later in Pacific time. and the current coincidence of Gale and Pasadena time will not recur for about 5 weeks.

<p class="date">August 31, 2012 - Friday</p>
<div class="description">
<p>The highlight of the Sol 24 plan is to test some of the software that will
allow the rover to avoid obstacles automatically. If the test, involving
taking images and processing them onboard the rover, is successful the
rover will drive farther toward our goal, called Glenelg. This location
will have a good view of the intersection of 3 different terrain types,
where we should be able to study the relationships between these geologic
units and therefore interpret their history. But to get there quickly we
will need to use the "autonomous navigation" that we are starting to check
out. After the drive, we have some time for science observations, which
were the focus of the science team's efforts today. It was my last shift
as SOWG Chair for a few weeks, and went more smoothly than yesterday's
planning. The biggest problem today was that the data volume expected to
be relayed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in time to plan Sol 25 is
very small, probably not enough to return the images we need to plan
another drive. Hopefully we will get more data through MRO than expected,
and we prioritized the various data products accordingly. If we don't get
at least one stereo pair of images of the terrain in front of the rover
after the drive, we will have to stay put for a sol. Obviously, this
wouldn't be a problem, but we would like get to Glenelg soon, and it is
about 400 m away.
</p>
<p>
We received confirmation that the last of the Mastcam characterization data
were acquired, so we were able to plan new Mastcam observations today.
This was a relief to the science team, and especially to me, as fitting it
all in to the plans over the past week required a lot of planning.

<p>
As predicted, we didn't receive enough data through MRO today to allow us to plan another drive. So while we wait for the images taken after the Sol 24 drive to arrive, we planned a bunch of images to be taken on Sol 25. I was MAHLI/MARDI Payload Uplink Lead 1 today, which means that my job was to focus on how best to use the Mars Hand-Lens Imager (MAHLI) and the Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) cameras. MAHLI is on the end of the instrument arm, which has not been checked out on Mars yet, so we can't use that camera yet. And you might expect that MARDI won't be used again because MSL already descended to the surface of Mars on August 5th. Well, it turns out that MARDI can still take useful pictures of Mars, looking straight down at the surface just behind the left front wheel of MSL. Eventually we hope to use MARDI to take images as MSL drives, but that won't be possible until the next version of the rover's software is uploaded and installed. In the meantime, we are taking a single MARDI image at each place the rover stops. So my job today was to find the best time to take such an image. The rover planners (drivers) didn't have much to do today, so I asked Matt Heverly, the rover mobility lead, to help me figure out whether this image would be in shadow or sunlight. We had received enough data through MRO to know that the Sol 14 drive went well, and that the rover heading was WSW (116.5 degrees azimuth relative to north). Using this information, Matt modeled the shadow of the rover in the fancy software the rover planners use to build drive and arm sequences, developed at JPL. We had planned a MARDI image on the afternoon of Sol 24 when the surface under the camera was fully shadowed, but didn't know whether it was successfully acquired because it was taken after MRO flew over MSL and received a burst of data from the rover. I thought that it would be interesting to see what the surface looks like when fully illuminated by the sun, and Matt's modeling showed that the surface would be in sunlight after 4:02 PM. Before that time, the rover would shadow the surface, but later the sunlight would pass under the rover for about an hour before sunset. So I suggested adding this observation to the plan at low priority, and the Geology theme lead agreed to include it. Because it didn't conflict with any other suggestions from the science team, it was included in the final plan that was submitted to the second-shift uplink planning team! So my work paid off and I look forward to seeing both the shadowed and sunlit images of the same spot. Comparing them will help us decide whether to take future MARDI images in sunlight or shadow.

<div class="description">
<p>The rover drivers are ready to test more advanced driving techniques and
software, but we stayed put today to finish the last of the Mastcam
characterization activities (the second half of the long-baseline stereo
experiment). So we had more room for new science observations in today's
plan than we have before, which was a challenge for the science team. Lots
of good ideas were brought forward by the various science theme groups,
including ChemCam measurement of rocks and soil, images of the sun and sky
to look for clouds, even neutron spectrometer measurements of hydrogen up
to 0.5 m below the surface. When the usual weather and radiation
"background" observations were included, there was a lot to prioritize and
fit in. But we did a pretty good job of fitting in everything we could.
Unfortunately, there were enough little problems with recent ChemCam
activities that we had to delete most of the ChemCam stuff from today's
plan. On the brighter side, removing them gave the second shift crew much
more confidence that they could get their job done in time to send the
commands to the rover. And we continue to learn how to do our jobs better
and get more science from MSL.

After a day off, I'm back on shift as SOWG Chair for 3 days. We had a
scare this morning when the Sol 21 data we expected to receive through the
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) was not received on time. Just as we
were starting to put together contingency plans for Sol 22, most of the
data were received from MRO (1.5 hours late). Happily, the Sol 21 drive
(4.9 m) to place the rover over one of the areas scoured clean by the
descent engines went perfectly, and the images taken after the drive
allowed us to plan another drive today. It was encouraging that the team
was able to recover from the 1.5-hour delay, allowing planning to proceed
as normal. Overall, the tactical team has gotten much better at putting
together complex plans, so we are able to include more and more activities
each day.

<p class="date">August 26, 2012 - Sunday</p>
<div class="description">
<p>
Today we received data from the first ChemCam “rasters,” in this case 5
laser shots in a row on 3 different targets. We were glad to see this
capability demonstrated on Mars, because we would like to use it a lot in
the future. The laser is focused on a spot less than 1 mm across, and the
chemistry of rocks and soils is commonly variable on the millimeter scale.
So multiple samples are needed to properly characterize the elemental
composition of each target, and the laser rasters will be useful in this
regard.
</p><p>
The SAM atmospheric sample test ran to completion, verifying that many
parts of this complicated instrument are working well. This was the last
SAM characterization test planned, and the team applauded the achievement
of this milestone. For this test a bit of Earth’s atmosphere was carried
to Mars, and analyzed successfully as planned. Now SAM is ready to acquire
and measure a sample of the Martian atmosphere.

I was sorry to hear today that Neil Armstrong, the first person to walk on
the Moon, passed away. His “small step” represented the culmination of an
amazing effort that inspired me as a child and helped lead me toward a
career in space exploration. I hope that NASA continues to inspire young
people with achievements such as the MSL mission.

I plan to take a day off tomorrow, before I begin a string of tactical
shifts on Monday. I’ll send my next update when I’m back on shift.

We've started getting Mastcam characterization data on the ground, and the key focus test data have allowed us to modify the command sequences sent to acquire more characterization data with the focus quality needed to make use of them. It's nice to see my recent efforts paying off, but of course it takes many people working very hard to make it happen. Today we planned a sequence of images intended to determine how well we can measure the topography of the surface far from the rover using "long-baseline stereo." MSL has several pairs of stereo cameras that work very much like human (and other animal) pairs of eyes. Our brains interpret the information from both eyes to tell how far away objects are, and cameras can be used to do the same thing. The distance between our eyes, or the "baseline" between cameras limits the distance at which this method works. The longer the baseline, or the greater the distance between cameras, the better the ability to measure distance. So our plan is to take pictures of Mt. Sharp, many kilometers from the rover, before and after moving the rover about 10 m. In order for this experiment to yield useful results, the camera must be properly focused. So it was good to receive some of the data from the focus test in time to plan this next experiment.
</p><p>
A different song is played at the beginning of each Martian day (sol) as the daily bundle of commands are sent to the rover. I'm not sure who picks the song each day, but this is a tradition that extends back to previous Mars landers. For example, here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_wvan-28Tw">video</a> to go along with today's wake-up song. It's great that people are taking the time to put together such videos, and I hope they are fun for the public

We have received all of the full-size MARDI images of MSL's descent,
and they have been combined into a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1ebHThBdlY&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL">video</a>. Watching this, with the audio from the mission support area dubbed in, brought a tear to my eye. The significance of landing successfully on
Mars using an entirely new, incredibly complex system, is still
sinking in. I am very fortunate to be involved in such an endeavor.
</p><p>
If you are not impressed with the MARDI video, stay tuned: the images
were each heavily compressed to allow them to be transmitted to Earth
quickly. The MARDI team has started reprocessing the raw images
onboard the rover to return higher-quality versions. Of course, it
will take a while to transmit all of these larger images to Earth, but
the results will be much better than the images we have on the ground
today. This is possible because each of the color cameras has its own
memory module that is used to store raw (uncompressed) images as they
are acquired. The raw images can therefore be reprocessed as desired
and then queued up for transmission. This is obviously a nice
capability to have, but the MSL team is still learning how to best
take advantage of it. As the performance of the radio link to the
Mars orbiters continues to improve, data are being received at an
unprecedented rate, so we are reprocessing color camera images to take
advantage of the better data rate.

<p>More cheers today when the rover planners (drivers) reported that the first
MSL drive went perfectly. It wouldn't be much of a rover mission if we
couldn't drive, so this was very good news. I feel extremely fortunate to
be involved in yet another successful Mars rover mission--we are now 4 for
4 (Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity), with 2 rovers still
active. Wow.
</p><p>
I spent most of the day continuing to work Mastcam characterization
sequences into the near-term plan. In addition to the daily tactical work,
many people are focused on planning what the rover will do for the next
week or so. I've been representing the Mastcam team's interests in these
strategic planning discussions and meetings, and despite numerous
constraints and evolving scientific goals, it has been going fairly well.
But it struck me today that it is a bit strange that I have been so focused
on Mastcam. To explain, I must first summarize how I got involved in the
first place: In 2004, many teams of scientists were preparing proposals
in response to NASA's announcement of an opportunity to develop, test and
operate instruments for the MSL mission. I was invited to join some of
these teams, and was included as a Co-Investigator on the ChemCam, MARDI
(descent imager) and MAHLI (hand-lens imager) proposals, but not on the
Mastcam proposal. The MARDI, MAHLI and Mastcam proposals were all
submitted by Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS), a small company in San
Diego specializing in building cameras to be flown on spacecraft. The
company was founded by Mike Malin after he was awarded a MacArthur
Fellowship (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacArthur_Fellows_Program">"genius grant"</a>) in 1987. Each of the proposals included a clause stating that if all 3 were selected,
MSSS would give NASA a 30% discount. Apparently NASA couldn't pass that
up, and all 3 cameras were selected to fly on MSL. In addition to
consolidating the design and test efforts at MSSS, the 3 science teams were
merged into one big team. So I became a member of the Mastcam team, along
with the other Co-Is on the MARDI and MAHLI science teams. But I always
expected to focus on MAHLI and MARDI, having put more effort into the
development of those cameras. While I didn't foresee my recent heavy
involvement in Mastcam planning, I was happy to contribute to the team
effort. I recognized the importance of getting the Mastcam
characterization data needed to improve the quality of the images as soon
as possible, and jumped right in. Hopefully this effort will pay off--we
expect the first results of the focus and stereo tests tomorrow morning.

<p>First the bad news: The REMS (meteorology experiment) team confirmed that
two out of 3 wind sensors on one of the two booms on the remote sensing
mast are permanently damaged and cannot be used. They are getting good
wind data from the other boom and are working on getting as much
information as possible from the one working sensor on the other boom. The
most likely explanation for the damage is that the descent rockets threw
dirt up on the top of MSL during landing, but it will be a while before we
can take pictures (using the camera on the arm) to confirm this. The other
sad news is that one of the leaders of the engineering team, Jake Matijevic
passed away last weekend. I worked with Jake on the Mars
Pathfinder/Sojourner project over 15 years ago, and again on the Mars
Exploration Rover project. I enjoyed every interaction I had with him, and
along with the rest of the MSL team will miss his contributions to the
latest, most ambitious rover project.</p>
<p>
And now the good news: More cheers and applause today as MSL successfully
deployed its arm and <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2012-254">wiggled its wheels</a> in preparation for its first drive. The first drive
was planned today, and everyone is anxious to see the results tomorrow
morning. It will be a short (3 m) drive, then a turn in place followed by
another short drive, intended to check out the mobility system. If all
goes well, we will be able to plan a longer (up to 10 m) drive next. After
the drive is complete, the rover will take a bunch of images to determine
exactly where it ended up, and to allow more observations to be targeted
from the new location. ChemCam continues to work well, returning data of
better quality than expected. Roger Wiens, the ChemCam Principal
Investigator, will summarize early results during a press conference
tomorrow at JPL.

<p>The MSL mission continues to go very well, with the first movement of the
rover wheels planned for tomorrow. The tactical operations team continues
to take on more challenges, planning more and more scientific observations
each day. I spent most of the day on strategic planning of the Mastcam
characterization sequences, trying to figure out how best to fit them in
among the other activities planned for the next few sols. This was a
refreshing change from my previous focus on tactical operations, but all of
this work is interesting.</p>
<p>
But the big news at JPL today was NASA's selection of the next Discovery
mission, called <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-rover-curiosity-is-about-to-roll-on-mars-nasa-chooses-a-2016-probe-of-planets-innards/2012/08/20/d9a65bbc-eb07-11e1-866f-60a00f604425_story.html" target="_blank">InSight</a>. The NASA Discovery program goal is to fly medium cost (less than $425 million) missions to the planets, and is very competitive. The decision was great news for JPL, as the mission is led by Bruce Banerdt, a JPL geophysicist, and will involve many other JPL scientists and engineers in the next few years. Despite the successful landing of MSL this month, JPL has had to lay off hundreds of employees, in part because the peak in the
effort to develop MSL has passed and there are few NASA planetary missions
in the queue. InSight, a mission to explore the interior of Mars using a
seismometer, will keep at least a few engineers and scientists busy,
avoiding further layoffs. This was especially good news to me because I
was concerned that the engineering expertise at JPL that enabled the
successful Mars Pathfinder, Mars Exploration Rover, MSL, and other missions
could have been lost if more layoffs were necessary. Once these engineers
are lost to other companies, it would be nearly impossible to get them back
at JPL in the future. Not only would may of them put down roots in other
places, many private companies pay engineers more than they are paid at
JPL. So keeping these talented individuals at JPL will be good for NASA
and good for planetary exploration.

<pre>Having completed the SOWG Chair shifts assigned to me over the past 4 days,
I didn't have to get up before dawn this morning. After trying
(unsuccessfully) to sleep in, I went straight to the ChemCam room at JPL to
see how the first Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectrometer (LIBS) data looked.
Fortunately, everything we planned yesterday worked well, and the ChemCam
team was ecstatic about the results: a better spectrum than expected, and
Remote Microscopic Imager (RMI) pictures taken before and after the LIBS
shots showing where on the rock the laser hit. What a great day for the
ChemCam team! <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2012-248&amp;cid=release_2012-248&amp;msource=2012248">More Information</a>.
I was hoping to spend more time looking at RMI data and catching up on
other work today, but ended up having to prepare a presentation on the plan
for characterization of the Mastcam cameras. We didn't have time to fully
test all of the capabilities of Mastcam before launch (too much other
testing to do), so we'll have to take a bunch of Mastcam images of Mars to
determine how best to focus the cameras and compress the data, among other
things. The Principal Investigator of Mastcam, Mike Malin, has not been
feeling well, so fellow team member Jim Bell and I volunteered to prepare
and give a presentation at the daily "science discussion" meeting this
afternoon. Jim is more familiar with the Mastcam experiment than I, but he
was on shift as Science Uplink Representative today and couldn't attend the
science discussion. So I gave the presentation and answered a few
questions about how and when the Mastcam characterization will be done,
hopefully in the next few days.
Meanwhile, the local Flagstaff newspaper, the Arizona Daily Sun, ran an
<a href="http://azdailysun.com/news/local/mission-diminished/article_87eddea1-ede7-5ea7-9e1b-fcaea75d3ef8.html">article</a> about the adverse effects that the cuts to NASA's fiscal 2013 Planetary Science budget would have on the USGS Astrogeology team if they are enacted by Congress. As described in the article, the outlook for Astrogeology is not very good, but the article is accompanied by a picture of me smiling happily. So a few of my colleagues asked my why I was smiling. The picture was taken while I was in Flagstaff last Monday, and apparently the photographer didn't know how it would be used, because he asked me to smile as I recalled the recent successful landing of MSL. I guess he should have take some pictures of me looking depressed just in case, but I'm hopeful that Congress will recognize that the Mars program is a source of great national pride and restore NASA's Planetary Science budget. Anyway, I'm enjoying being involved in an exciting rover mission while I can.

<pre>I served as SOWG Chair again today, planning Sol 13 activities for MSL.
The tactical planning team is getting better at getting everything done in
time to send commands to the rover, so we were able to fit more new
scientific observations into the plan today. Fortunately, the science team
was led by an "all star" crew today, including Steve Squyres as Geology
Science Theme Lead. Steve is the Principal Investigator of the science
payload on the Mars Exploration Rovers that landed on Mars in January
2004--first Spirit, then Opportunity. I have been working for Steve as
science lead for the Microscopic imager, the close-up camera on the MER
instrument arms. So we were joking today about the role reversal--as SOWG
Chair I lead the science team today. The Opportunity mission continues to
be operated from the floor above the one where the MSL team has been
working, so I reminded him that upstairs he's still my boss. It was great
to have such expert support today, and we put together a good plan.
Mid-way through the planning process we learned that the SAM instrument
checkout planned for Sol 14 would have to be spread over two Sols because
the successful completion of the first part of the checkout would have to
be confirmed by analyzing the results on Earth before the second part could
start. To avoid having to spend an extra sol to get this done, we
scrambled to move the first part of the checkout into the Sol 13 plan.
I'll spare you the details, but suffice it to say that it was not easy. We
handed the new plan off to the second shift, and hope that they will be
able to implement it.
So now I'm done with the set of four shifts as SOWG Chair, as scheduled.
It was exhilarating and I'm glad I had the opportunity to serve the project
in this role, but I'm also glad to have a break for a few days. I'm hoping
to get more sleep tonight and to catch up on all the other work that has
been piling up over the past week. I'm also looking forward to having more
time to analyze the data we have received from MSL and attend the Science
Discussion meeting, which always conflict with tactical planning meetings.

<h2 class="title">Sol 12 Update on Curiosity from USGS Scientist Ken Herkenhoff: Mars Time</h2>
<p class="date">August 18, 2012 - Saturday</p>
<div class="description">
<pre>Those of us supporting MSL tactical mission operations are living on "Mars time." A day on Mars, or "sol" is about 40 minutes longer than a day on Earth, but our workday doesn't shift exactly 40 minutes later each day because the tactical schedule is tied to the receipt of data from the orbiters that are relaying information from MSL to Earth. Each orbiter (MRO and Mars Odyssey) flies over MSL twice a day, early in the morning and late in the afternoon. But they don't fly over MSL at the same time every day, because their orbits were designed to view different parts of Mars every sol so that the orbiter instruments can observe a wide variety of locations on the planet. So the start time of the tactical shifts can vary by up to a couple hours from day to day, but overall slips later and later, cycling through 24 hours on Earth in about 5 weeks. I had been getting to JPL at about 5:30 each morning, but didn't have to be there until 6:30 this morning. I was treated to a beautiful sunrise when I arrived, and felt more like an Earthling than a Martian for a change!
Today's planning of MSL activities went very well--the operations team is learning how to work more efficiently while ensuring that every command is safe to send to the rover. Meanwhile, the rest of the science team discussed where to drive after the mobility system is checked out. The favored plan is to drive toward the east to examine an outcrop of <a href="/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4482">bright material</a>. But first, we have to make sure everything is working well. The good news today was that the DAN neutron experiment is working well, and SAM's electrical baseline test was successful. More instrument checkouts are planned for the next few sols--more on those later.

<h2 class="title">Sol 11 Update on Curiosity from USGS Scientist Ken Herkenhoff: ChemCam Testing</h2>
<p class="date">August 16, 2012 - Thursday</p>
<div class="description">
<pre>I served as SOWG chair again today, planning Sol 11 of the MSL mission.
All is going well, but slowly--we continue to confirm that instruments are
working and to get ready for more ambitious activities. Today's plan was
so full of stuff that we have to do to realize the full potential of MSL
that we couldn't add new observations based on the data we have received so
far. For example, a full hour of the day was spent setting software
parameters for all the motors on the rover--thousands of parameters! This
is indeed a very complex system. But the rover is healthy and the planning
team is getting better at preparing ever more complicated command sequences
to send to MSL.
The most exciting news today was that the ChemCam and Chemin instruments
successfully returned their first data. ChemCam is the remote chemical
analysis instrument that uses a laser to vaporize rock/soil up to 7 meters
away, creating a plasma of ions and excited atoms that emit photons as
their electrons relax to lower energy states. These "electronic
transitions" are measured by sensitive spectrometers, yielding spectral
peaks that indicate which elements are present in the target. In
preparation for such observations, we tested the pointing of the instrument
by taking pictures of a calibration target on the rover with the Remote
Microscopic Imager (RMI), a camera that uses the same optics as the laser
and spectrometers to show where the laser hit the target. We didn't fire
the laser yet, because we want to be sure that the pointing is accurate
first. We wouldn't want to shoot the rover by mistake! But the RMI images
show that the pointing is very good, and they will allow us to improve the
pointing by analyzing the offsets relative to the center of the calibration
target. Most importantly, both ChemCam and Chemin (the X-ray instrument
that will determine what minerals are present in samples delivered to it)
are working as well as expected--everyone applauded when the initial
results were reported!

<p class="date">August 15, 2012 - Wednesday</p>
<div class="description">
<pre>After a nice vacation in Flagstaff, I returned to JPL in time for Sol 10
planning. I was scheduled this time as Science Operations Working Group
(SOWG) Chair, with responsibility for leading the discussion of data
received the previous sol and deciding what to do the next sol. This job
is part of the first shift, which just happened to start at about the same
time I was starting my second shift PUL work before my break in Flagstaff.
So I arrived at JPL around 5:15 AM, early in twilight, when the waning
crescent moon, Venus and Jupiter formed a beautiful line among the "winter"
constellations rising in the east. A nice aspect of working first shift is
that it involves more interaction with the science team, which is less
involved in detailed command sequence planning during second shift. I
started my work day by getting back up to speed on rover operations,
looking at recent data and discussing priorities for new scientific
observations. Rover checkout continues, and we are getting more scientific
data from various instruments.
During the first big meeting of the day, the "Science Kickoff," we heard
updates on each of the instruments. We all applauded when the Dynamic
Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) instrument reported successful completion of their
first "passive" observation, in which naturally-generated neutrons were
measured from Mars. We also received some more MARDI (descent image) full
frames, all of which are beautiful, and there are many more MARDI images
still awaiting transmission to Earth. More instrument checkouts were
planned for Sol 10, as well as continued updates of rover software. At the
end of my shift, I handed off science leadership to the SUR (Science Uplink
Representative, the same role I filled during the first 3 planning sols)
and gave him some advice based on my previous experience. Then I attended
a cameras team meeting in another building at JPL that ended up running
late, so that I didn't leave JPL until about 6:30, over 13 hours after I
arrived. But I felt good despite the long hours, and recalled working an
average of 14 hours/day during the early part of the Spirit and Opportunity
missions. So not a bad day at all!

<p class="date">August 08, 2012 - Wednesday</p>
<div class="description">
<pre> Another good day on Mars: MSL's remote sensing mast was successfully
deployed, and a Navcam panorama acquired. Not all of the images have been
sent to Earth yet, but those that have been received are very useful for
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA16011">planning future observations</a>. In addition, more full-resolution descent images have been received, showing the <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2012-235#1">heat shield</a> soon after it was jettisoned and the <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2012-235#10">surface close-up</a> after landing. Hundreds of MARDI images like these were acquired during descent and landing, and it will take weeks to months to send them back to Earth. But when they are
received, the full-resolution animation of the descent sequence will be spectacular. This has been the theme of the mission so far--we must be patient.
Today was my last shift this month as Science Uplink Representative,
and planning went well again. The plan for Sol 3 included a Mastcam color
panorama which will have about 4x better resolution than the Navcam black
and white panorama. The plan also includes checkouts of 4 of the
instruments that have not been turned on since landing: the Alpha Particle
X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), which will measure elemental chemistry; the
Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) experiment, which will measure the
abundance of hydrogen (water) up to 1 m below the surface; CheMin, an X-ray
diffraction and fluorescence instrument that will determine the mineralogy
of samples delivered to it by the rover's arm; and SAM, the Sample Analysis
at Mars suite of 3 instruments that will search for organics and measure
the isotopic composition of Martian rocks, soil and atmosphere. Of course
we all hope that these instruments have survived landing and are working
well.
My tactical operations shifts have been exciting, and I've enjoyed
working with the talented and knowledgeable engineers and scientist on the
tactical team. But I'm also looking forward to taking a break for a few
days and sleeping past 4:30 in the morning!

<h2 class="title">Sol 2 Update on Curiosity from USGS Scientist, Ken Herkenhoff: Planning Report</h2>
<p class="date">August 07, 2012 - Tuesday</p>
<div class="description">
<pre> Today I'm working as Science Uplink Representative again, planning
Sol 2 activities. We now know exactly where MSL is, thanks to more good
work by the MRO HiRISE team: They acquired a new image of the landing area
that shows not only the rover, but its heat shield, parachute, and descent
stage, all in the <a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2012/details/cut/landing_site_annotated.jpg">same image</a>!
So the MSL team is starting to plan where to drive, but I have not been
directly involved in those discussions because they have been occurring
during first shift. Certainly we must move out of the area contaminated by
the landing rockets before analyzing samples of the soil.
The plan for today includes deploying the remote sensing mast,
obviously an important activity, as we cannot use the mast cameras and
ChemCam instrument until the mast is deployed. Once the mast has been
deployed, the navigation cameras will take a full, 360-degree panorama of
the terrain around us and another panorama of the rover deck. Based on the
hazard avoidance camera <a href="/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4271"> images received so far</a>, the Navcam panorama should be spectacular!
During one of the tactical planning meeting today, we were
interrupted by the Project Manager for a surprise visit from U.S.
Congressman John Culberson of Texas. He was impressed by the mission
operations area and vowed to protect us from interference from NASA
Headquarters, so that we can do our jobs efficiently. I'm not particularly
fond of politicians, but it was an honor to hear him thank us for our
efforts and we all applauded after his brief speech. Hopefully he will
vote to restore funding for NASA's Mars Program in fiscal 2013!

<h2 class="title">Sol 1 Update on Curiosity from USGS Scientist Ken Herkenhoff: Tactical Operations</h2>
<p class="date">August 06, 2012 - Monday</p>
<div class="description">
<pre> I'm working second shift today; my tactical operations role is
Science Uplink Representative. As the title implies, my responsibility is
to represent the science team during the uplink planning process (preparing
command sequences to be transmitted to the spacecraft). The early part of
the MSL mission, called the Characterization Activity Phase, has been
planned and tested in detail; the nominal command sequences were loaded
onto the spacecraft well before landing. As long as the mission continues
to proceed nominally, no changes to the sequences will be needed, and the
uplink planning process will primarily involve modeling the planned
activities to confirm that they should be executed.
It was difficult to leave JPL soon after landing, but I knew I had to
get some sleep before my shift started at 5:30 PDT. I got almost 4 hours
of sleep, so I'm doing fine so far. I arrived at JPL as morning twilight
began, with Venus and Jupiter shining brightly over the San Gabriel
Mountains. Many team members were still at JPL when I arrived, but because
they had been up all night, most of them left soon after sunrise in
Pasadena. It was then much quieter in the operations area as the team
focused on uplink planning. As I met colleagues I hadn't seen earlier, we
congratulated each other but the excitement of landing had mostly passed.
Of course everyone is happy to be involved in the surface phase of the
mission, but the focus is now on doing the jobs we have been rehearsing for
the past few months. One of the rehearsals simulated multiple anomalies,
and we are all glad that our experience in responding to anomalies has not
been needed. The mission is going so well that the mood has gone from
"adrenaline rush" to "business as usual" in just a few hours.
We just received several of the Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) images,
showing sections of the "movie" of the descent and landing from the rover.
Applause broke out in the camera team's room as the PI, Mike Malin, showed
us the data. These images will allow us to locate the rover precisely.
Earlier this morning the MRO HiRISE image of the lander descending on its
parachute was received, and it is SPECTACULAR. It is the result of months of
planning, requiring coordination between the MSL and MRO projects to
complete a very complicated observation design. The HiRISE team did a
great job in support of MSL!

<h2 class="title">Update on Curiosity from USGS Scientist Ken Herkenhoff: MSL Curiosity Rover lands on Mars!</h2>
<p class="date">August 05, 2012 - Sunday</p>
<div class="description">
<pre>All three of the USGS scientists involved in MSL are in a large <br>conference room in JPL building 321, along with over 400 other science team
members. The tension in the room is rising as MSL approaches Mars. Mars
Odyssey is in position and sending a good signal, ready to relay data from
MSL during descent. Each announcement (via video from the Mission Support
Area in a nearby building at JPL) is greeted with applause and cheers:
Good signal from Odyssey, cruise stage separation, turn to entry attitude,
etc. A few minutes ago, the Project Science Office led a brief "all hands"
meeting of the science team, encouraging us to work as a team, be patient,
and above all, have fun!
With 5 minutes to entry, it is quiet both in the MSA and in Bldg.
321. Because the radio signals from Mars take over 14 minutes to reach
Earth, MSL has already landed successfully (or perhaps not), but we won't
know for a while. This is the most critical phase of the entire mission,
and must be executed perfectly by the spacecraft computer without any
control from Earth. I haven't been nervous all day, but my heart rate is
now quickening. The outcome of EDL will have a major effect on my career,
but there is nothing I can do about it except watch with everyone else.
What a crazy business! But I love it.
As MSL descends through the atmosphere, it will not be visible from
Earth, so its radio signals must be relayed by Odyssey. So a cheer goes up
when Odyssey data is first received. Another big cheer when the parachute
deployment is reported. Direct communication to Earth is lost as expected,
just before the lander separates from the parachute and retro-rockets
start. Another cheer as sky crane starts! When the signal is received
showing that MSL has landed successfully, everyone in the MSA and in 321
jump up at once, cheering and clapping loudly. Within a few minutes the
first pictures from MSL Hazard Avoidance Cameras are received via Odyssey
and even louder cheers erupt from both rooms.
Given the successful landings of Mars Pathfinder and both Mars
Exploration Rovers, I should have expected another success, but I wasn't.
MSL is so much more complex than previous missions, and the EDL so much
more difficult, that I was prepared for the worst. My heart is still
racing, many minutes after landing. I'm on second shift (uplink), so I
have to get some sleep before returning to JPL by 5:30 tomorrow morning. I
don't know how I will be able to sleep!
